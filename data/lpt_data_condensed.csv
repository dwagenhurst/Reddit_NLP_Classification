There is a subtle art to engaging someone without seeming to pry or patronize but if you want to learn more try to listen to other people more often than share your own thoughts and ask questions about things that matter to them. If its boring you can bounce but I meet interesting people and learn a lot more meeting people by trying to shut up and actually hear what people say.  Practice with seniors you may meet. They may be annoyed at first but many older people have few friends or relatives left and have lived interesting lives. Asking good questions and you may learn something or make someone's day being nice. This isn't for everyone but so many people are mean and weird in public now I am forced to try to be nicer. And there are a lot of disenfranchised seniors (and young people too) who have might benefit from a normal conversation.,LPT: Having better conversations with people you just met is more about listening than talking.

It also goes deeper than that, the limiting beliefs we have on our capabilities and the beliefs we have about other races.

Do NOT take the person's word for it, even if it's more than one person, do NOT trust caller ID, etc.

* If you receive a call/text about one of your accounts having fraudulent activity, go to the source completely on your own and check.  (Log in by typing the URL yourself).  Do NOT click links in an email, in a text, etc.  Do NOT provide your pin, password, etc.  Even though the caller ID may show your bank name, do NOT assume that it is your bank calling.
* If you receive an email, you can often hover over the sender and see the real sender address first.  These can still be spoofed, so remember to always go to the URL yourself and do not use links.  Close and reopen the browser and log into your credit card, Amazon, wherever and look.  Find customer support on your own and call THAT number.
* *Real* customer service and fraud departments have zero problems with you hanging up and calling back, such as calling the number on the back of your credit card, going to the website to report, etc.  They may recommend, but will not pressure you into taking immediate action.  Nothing is THAT urgent where you cannot spare a few minutes.
* There are a great deal of scams centered around Amazon, Apple, Medicare, Account Services, Credit Cards/Banks, IRS, Social Security, Car Warranties, Vacations, online romance, utilities, craigslist, rentals, LinkedIn job applications, Venmo/Zelle/PayPal/gift cards.
* As much as I do not want to say it, based on experience, many scam callers will have an Indian accent.  Scams may often have you press a number before proceeding, like press 1 (just hang up instead of pressing anything).
* Fake checks are often used for scams.  Checks can take MONTHS to fully clear, especially if they are international.  Just because your bank cashes a check and makes money available in your account does NOT mean a cash is checked.  Anyone asking you to cash a check or 'accidentally' sending more money and asking you to send it back, or make a purchase from a particular business/website, is very likely a scam.

  
These people pray on fear and desperation; Fear of missing out or fear of missing a great opportunity.  If something is too good to be true, even an online shopping price, it very likely is.  Ask yourself if saving a few bucks is worth it.

I'm just trying to bring more awareness to mental health through my story and how the voices and delusions (Schizophrenia) influenced me to do a lot of things that I wouldn't have otherwise done. For example I got In trouble with the law because I believed I sold my soul and tried getting it back and then I thought was the Holy spirit because I heard the voice of God and thought I was the one and only and I thought I was the messenger. During a psychotic episode I created an Album (High Quality) to try to influence people to be better because that's what I thought my role as the Holy spirit was, but I can see now I was delusional but the good intent behind the songs are still relevant. My spotify Bio has more details. I'm trying let people know how a mental illness could start and that it could be spotted by a family member or a friend and then a treatment plan can be put in place with the proper help. The purpose of my album is to help others understand what someone developing schizophrenia could be going through because feeling chosen is a common delusion and to learn the thought process behind it. The song Thankful is about giving back so I'm sharing the profits with 2 listeners per month and that's what would make me feel good about people listening to it. More details can be found on my TikTok or any other social media. My album is called ""The Psychotic Episode"" by Banq Official. I really hope you enjoy your experience. Thanks for listening.

Now I have boarding group 2 which is really like 6th behind elites, handicapped, children, military and group 1 because of my credit card and zero status. Group 1 is always like 25% of the plane, everyone in the sharp end of the plane and economy plus.

What I noticed—and literally this is the first flight I have not seen it done this way— is when they seat standby and non-revs, they put non-revs in the economy plus and standbys in whatever they are eligible for, from the FRONT to back nearly every time.

If you are group 2, your seat likely sucks unless you pay for economy plus. I never do that. Instead, I look at the length of the standby list and see if it is deep. Today’s flight has 7 non- revs/standby. The plane ends at 39 which always has a bathroom.
Assuming the flight is nearly full, but not quite — like 90% to 97%— I choose a window or aisle near the back far enough from the toilet (for obvious reasons) but near the back that has a middle seat open. There are like 10 middle seats ahead of me open and a standy list of 7. 36 isn’t ideal, but given that I am delayed on the tarmac for an hour, I will take the extra space over the proximity.

So I am about 7 rows further back than I could be, but the middle seat is open, so I have maximized my terrible seat. It ain’t much, but that extra 3 feet of space is nice. Huge benefit on red eyes and long flights. Even when I had status and knew an upgrade wouldn’t clear, I moved back for the middle seat empty.

Added bonus is all the people back here with me are nearly all group 3 and above, so boarding has nobody bumping into me, and I get my pick of the overhead bins which were 100% filled in economy plus when I boarded, already.

If something happens to your pet, the consequences can be devastating. Accidents always happen when you least expect them, this goes for your pets as well. Recently a relatively old cat from our neighbors passed away and the hospital where he blew out his final breath had a ton of questions they hadn't expected.

When something does happen to your pet, the follow hours often become an emotional roller-coaster. Animal hospitals will ask you all sorts of questions but your thought is only going to be with the animal on the bed. The chances of you coming up with a rational, non-emotional answer are pretty slim, yet you have to decide the fate of your pet relatively quickly.

It's always better to be prepared for these kind of questions in advance, so you can focus on the recovery (or in worst case) grieving period. Even though it can be really hard, write down answers for questions like:

* What if he/she gets a tumor? At what cost and on what age/state of being do you decide not to operate?
* If your pet dies, do you want it preserved by means of taxidermy? Do you want to take them home or leave them at the hospital? Does your local law allow burial in the back yard?
* In what condition will you decide to let the pet go and prevent the suffering?

LifeProTips,/r/LifeProTips/comments/u7us6f/lpt_staying_warm_and_safe_this_winter/," **Clothing:**

**Layers**. Always dress in layers (and bring layers with you). Not only do layers create more pockets of air (which help insulate), but also allow you to avoiding sweating (which will cool you off the fastest). This also goes for your legs. It might not be sexy, but long underwear or tights underneath your pants will make an enormous difference. High end winter gear creates this by design (down/fur), try to mimic this functionality with your layers. \*Edit: Generally you will have three:

1. Baselayer (thermals/long underwear). Merino wool is go to here, but pricey. There are many synthetic alternatives, however, that will definitely do the trick. Also, quick tip and make sure that the combination of your socks/thermals don't cut into your skin (becomes an issue with ski and hiking boots). If you have high quality socks, consider getting ones that only go down to mid-calf. This layer should be quite tight and extremely soft/comfortable, and breathable. It also needs to maintain warmth when wet because this is the one that's going to get sweaty (which is bad, but prepare for it anyway).  

2. Midlayer. On super cold days this can actually be two layers. A breathable fleece/synthetic sweatshirt type layer (see the Arcteryx shirt I linked in the cotton section), and an insulation layer (which is not really breathable). The insulation layer will almost always be some form of down (and will be integrated into heavy parkas). [For this layer I'm really loving the new ""synthetic down""](http://web.archive.org/web/20151126002843/http://www.patagonia.com/us/shop/womens-insulation-synthetic-insulation?k=1E-6V-aY). It's so light and squishy and easy to store when you need to (which is awesome, because this is likely the first layer that you'll want to store).
3. The wind/waterproof layer (AKA, the shitty weather layer). This is where you'll spend the big bucks, but in a pinch, a goddamn plastic bag is better than nothing. This layer is what is stopping windchill and rain **only**. And often, you'll keep the lighter midlayer + this one after you get halfway down your run. Or to work. Or whatever.  


**Loose**. Do **not** restrict your circulation. Especially on your appendages (feet/fingers). Yes, that extra pair of socks might seem like a great idea, but if you have to squish into your boots, I promise that your feet will be colder. Same goes for gloves (mitts are usually better for that reason). Imagine creating little sealed layers of air between you an the cold (like a thermos. sort of).

**Cotton is the worst**. Jeans, shirts, dress pants whatever. If it isn't wool or synthetic, it will get wet, stay wet, and provide very little insulation even when dry and zero protection from the wind. Avoid at all costs. *Edit: Smartwool and Merino wool are the latest go to (especially for baselayers), but my favourite midlayer is* [*this hoodie*](http://web.archive.org/web/20151126002843/http://arcteryx.com/product.aspx?language=EN&amp;gender=womens&amp;category=Mid_Layer_and_Fleece&amp;subcat=Athletic&amp;model=Thaleia-Hoody-W)*. I wear it almost every day, especially after working out. It's great because it still lets the sweat evaporate, but without letting you get cold.*

**Behaviour:**

1. **Protect yourself from the wind**. Yes, cover your ears/face/exposed skin with clothing, but also stand in whatever shelter available and walk next to buildings to avoid the wind. It's a myth that you lose more heat from your head than any other body part... but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't cover it like you would any other body part. My father always told me: *You don't need to cover all your extremities, just the ones you want to keep.*
2. **Make the most of the heat you have**. Get dressed inside and wait for all the little pockets of air to warm up before you go outside.
3. **Do not get wet**. Either from sweat or anything else. Getting wet will give you hypothermia/frostbite in minutes vs hours. If you feel yourself starting to sweat, immediately take off a layer... Or two. Whatever it takes. If it's slushy you're usually better off with $20 gumboots and a good pair of socks, rather than non-waterproof boots.",LPT: Staying warm and safe this winter

LifeProTips,/r/LifeProTips/comments/u7upwo/lpt_taking_a_cooler_on_a_long_trip_freeze_a_case/," Benefit:

Doing this keeps your food drier since you won't have ice melting into a pool of water, and you're not wasting space with ice packs that you can't eat or drink. If you'll be staying somewhere with a freezer during your trip, save the bottles to refill and refreeze.

Bottle Choice:

Normal plastic water bottles and milk jugs won't explode when they freeze because they are built to expand. If you use a different kind of bottle, make sure you leave some air space to allow for ice expansion. Don't use glass bottles; there's a breakage risk and they're heavy. If you're buying ice, take it out of the retail bag and repack it in Ziplock bags to reduce meltwater messes. You can also freeze your own water in Ziplock bags; lay them flat in the freezer to make ice thick sheets.

Some people worry about carcinogens or other toxins from freezing or using plastic water bottles. There's [no](http://cancer.about.com/od/cancercausesfaq/f/freezingwaterbo.htm) [need](http://www.jhsph.edu/dioxins) [to](http://www.plasticsmythbuster.org/main-menu/plastics-rumor-registry/freezing-plastic-water-bottles-releases-dioxins-into-water-) [worry](http://www.fitsugar.com/Bad-Freeze-Disposable-Water-Bottles-148073).

Cooler Prep:

1. **Wash your cooler well** before use and before storage with warm, soapy water. Vinegar or a water-bleach solution can help banish smells.
2. **Make sure you pre-chill all the food** before you put it in the cooler. If your food can be frozen without affecting the quality (milk, most soups, chilis, etc.) and you won't need it right away, freeze it. You can freeze juice boxes. Don't freeze canned beverages or foods.
3. If you have a large freezer with enough room, **freeze your entire cooler** for a few hours before loading it. If your freezer isn't that big, you can pre-cool your cooler putting some ice in it for 6+ hours. Dump out the meltwater and dry it out, then load it up. At the very least, bring your cooler down to room temperature for a couple of days (lid open) if it's been stored in a hot garage, attic, or other building.

Packing:

1. **For some cool drinking water at the start of your trip**, freeze some half-full bottles and then fill them up with cold water just before you put them in the cooler.
2. One large cooler will generally keep your food colder than two smaller ones, but having a **separate cooler for beverages** may help your perishable food stay cold longer, since there will be fewer lid openings that let hot air in. Or have a separate cooler for dairy/meat, which are more prone to spoilage.
3. **Pack related items together inside a large ziplock bag**, such as condiments or sandwich ingredients, or everything you'll need for a certain meal. That way it's easier to find everything you need quickly so the cooler is open for shorter times, and the food will stay drier. Pack what you'll need first at the top of the cooler. Throw in a few extra bags to store leftovers. Foods that come in a ""resealable"" package will probably not stay dry if they get submerged in meltwater once they've been opened; put them in a ziplock bag.
4. Plastic **egg carrier cases** work well, but they take up a lot of space even when they're almost empty. (Two small carriers is better than one large one!) A cardboard egg carton inside a plastic bag is fine as long as you're careful not to crush it, and if space is needed you can cut off the unused cells. Hard-boiled eggs can be pre-peeled and kept in a ziplock bag. If you're making scrambled eggs, pre-mix them and put them in a tight-sealing container or wide-mouth bottle. It is possible to freeze eggs too, but [with some preparation](https://www.google.com/search?q=freeze+raw+eggs). (If you live outside of the U.S., where your [eggs are unwashed](http://www.forbes.com/sites/nadiaarumugam/2012/10/25/why-american-eggs-would-be-illegal-in-a-british-supermarket-and-vice-versa/), you don't need to keep your unbroken eggs in the cooler unless you're somewhere *really* hot.)
5. Wash and dry raw fruits and vegetables before you leave. Vegetables can usually be cut ahead of time too. Partially prepare recipes when possible.

Keeping it Cold:

1. If you don't use frozen water bottles but opt for ice instead: **draining the meltwater** may be beneficial for sanitary reasons (cross contamination risk) but keeping it helps the cooler stay cold longer. Ice chips and shaved ice melt faster than block ice. Consider repacking ice into Ziplock bags when you buy it.
2. **Keep your cooler out of the sun, and don't leave it in a hot vehicle** if you can safely store it somewhere else. If it does have to stay in the sun or a vehicle, cover it with a blanket, towel, sleeping bag, or shade it with a tarp or reflective emergency blanket. (If you're camping, don't leave your cooler in your tent or outside. Hungry animals and/or people will show up.)
3. **Keep a thermometer in your cooler.** Your food should stay below the ""[danger zone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danger_zone_(food_safety))"" temperature of 5°C / 41°F. Foods that are potentially hazardous if they spend two or more hours in the danger zone are: meat, fish, poultry, eggs, protein rich foods, dairy products, cut or peeled fresh produce, most cooked foods, shellfish, sauces and gravies, sprouts, and any foods that contain any of these items.
4. For long trips, and/or if you need food to stay frozen, **consider using dry ice** or ""card ice"", which is carbon dioxide frozen at -109.3°F / -78.5°C. Dry ice is non-toxic but it can cause rapid frostbite, asphyxiation, and other problems; read more about [safely handling and storing dry ice](http://www.dryiceinfo.com/safe.htm) before you buy. Dry ice *can* go in your main cooler if wrapped in a towel, but a more convenient option is to have a second cooler with just dry ice and frozen water bottles (and any food you want to keep frozen); transfer water bottles to the main cooler as needed. If you plan to use dry ice, also read about [quantity needed, packing, and transport tips](http://www.dryiceinfo.com/camping.htm).
5. In sunny weather, your parked vehicle can get really hot, really fast. You can **use a dry cooler for heat-sensitive items**, such as phones, cameras, and other electronics. The inside of the cooler will stay at ambient temperature for many hours even if your car's interior hits 140°F / 60°C. If you have an extra dry cooler and enough space, you may wish to chill other food items that don't require refrigeration, such as bread and apples, too keep them fresher.","LPT: Taking a cooler on a long trip?

The 'invisible solid' deodorant leaves clumps of sweat and hair behind and it's really resistant to soap and water. Use hand sanitzer \[though I expect rubbing alcohol to work just as well\] to remove the gunk.

The deodorant \[this applies to the solid white deodorant not the clear gel ones\] builds up over the day as a gunk of sweat and stuff. It's resistant to water because, duh, antipersperant. Normally it easy to wipe off but if you have, say a lot of underarm hair, it gets stuck and is a pain to get off. A bit of alcohol makes the gunk denature and easy to wipe off and then you can wash normally. This doesn't apply to spray or gel deodorant but to the white solid antipersperant.

Please don't use this method after shaving because of the alcohol but others have pointed out shampoo as a \[sorta\]safe alternative.

Why is this needed: if you live in a hot/humid climate, sweat a lot, use cheap antipersperant, have a bush under your arm, on and on. Mind, I am a girl and this does happen to my female friends as well, hair or no hair so perhaps it's just the weather and the methods we use. :)

I have tried walking for a period to warm up the muscles but even then I can get light shin splints and they worsen when I pick up the pace. I've tried stretching to no avail. I don't know if it's because the muscles on the front of my are just not strong enough or what. I try not to go too fast with my training but this has been happening for years and I have seen no improvement. Any suggestions? My girlfriend wants to do a 5k and I don't want to miss out on that!

I am aware that this could be caused by improper running form as well as flat feet. I have high arches and I do my best to keep the best running form as possible.",[LPT REQUEST] How do I get rid of or alleviate shin splints?

LifeProTips,/r/LifeProTips/comments/u7rbjs/lpt_ever_wonder_why_youre_smart_but_you_cant/,"You've just finished a difficult problem set. It was tough, some of the other students in your class couldn't do it. You got every single one right. Your professor comes up to you, ""Hey, you're very **intelligent**. Good job with the work."" How does this *condition* you?

The professor hands out a more difficult problem set, this time you don't get every single one right. But hey, it was more difficult so no biggy.

This pattern continues and so does the conditioning. You were told that you were intelligent (enough) to correctly complete the first problem set. This gave you a static interpretation of your intelligence: ""I am smarter than this problem set, however the next one I got a few wrong on so my intelligence dwindles there and eventually, with more problem sets, falls off entirely."" This is how your subconscious mind sees yourself. Limited. You don't put in any more effort because you have capped out, reached the max, you are done. You give up.

Now let's rethink this. Imagine the same scenario, but instead of the professor (or your parents or peers) saying to you that you are *intelligent* they instead say you are *hard working*. You have not changed, you are the same as the first scenario, but immediately your conditioning is different. Now the thing that allowed you to complete that first problem set perfectly wasn't a **static intelligence level**, but instead it was your **effort and your drive**. On the next problem set you don't look at it as beyond your intelligence, you see it as requiring a little more effort, a few more steps. You don't give up.

So, when you were growing up, were you told you were intelligent or a hard worker? How do you think that reflects on you now?

That is why you should always motivate children by dynamic instead of static variables if you want to see continuous improvement.

LifeProTips,/r/LifeProTips/comments/u7r6d1/lpt_clean_a_slightly_dirty_car_quicky_and/,"I am a chauffeur, and one of the tasks I have to do at the end of my shift is to bring the car in washed. The normal wash places are always closed, and the auto wash places don't have good value for my money.

First, I go to one of those self-spray car wash places. These offer amazing band for your buck. You control how much time you want, and which features to use.

The minimum charge at the one I use is $1.25. This gives me about four minutes of wash time. If I were to try to use all the functions, I'd never make it because it takes so much time to get around the car. So here are the two features I use:

* High Pressure Wash.
* High Pressure Wax.

When you bucket wash, you'll pre-rinse as a prep, as wetted dirt and grime sticks less. But If you go through drive-thru car washes, you'll find that some don't bother with a pre-rinse cycle. They immediately soap the car down. The high pressure wash is essentially doing both at the same time. Use this to your adavantage. Be sure to spray the bottom and wheel wells, and you'll be fine.

The high pressure wax easily has enough pressure to rinse the soap off. So I use this to rinse and give the car a nice sheen afterward.

Now, if my bosses complained, I would find another option, but I have developed a reputation of keeping the car in such good shape when I come in, that my bosses don't bother to inspect them. ""We trust you, Saxon. You always bring the car in clean.""

This is far faster, far cheaper, and a lot less dull than using a drive thru. The water is always kept a little warmer than usual, probably to protect the pipes from freezing in the winter, and the long wand makes it difficult to get myself wet anyway.

Now, if your car is positively filthy, this technique probably won't serve your purposes. It'll take too long, and you won't have enough time to make use of all the needed attributes.

I decided to search for remedies and one of the most common ones I came across was to avoid toothpastes with sodium dodecyl sulfate. It's a stupid foaming agent that does exactly that...foam, to create the illusion of the toothpaste doing a thorough cleaning... That's all it does.

I switched to sodium dodecyl sulfate free toothpaste and within a month all my canker sores were gone, this was almost 3 years ago.

A couple of weeks back I decided I wanted to try one of those 'whitening' toothpastes, and decided to only use it at night. I kept using my other toothpaste in between meals. Well, the canker sores are back and my whitening toothpaste is in the trash now. This is what prompted me to post this.

C is the lowest offer, so this can be disregard.

- Company B long story short: negotiated and met me at the bottom of my range. I then said, “let me think about it cause I’ve got two other offers to review.” I revealed the highest offer (added extra $3k in there), then company B said they wanted to give me a competitive offer but need to discuss internally. I havent heard back from them since. It’s been two days.

- Company A: highest offer yet, but it was $4k under my asking salary. I’m just disappointed cause they seemed okay with the range I mentioned during interview. This company is my top candidate so far. I want to see if they can give me additional $4k per year (to meet me at my asking salary). 
Three people who interviewed me within the company have reached out to me separately telling me how impressed they are with my skills and hope to see me joining the team. I haven’t countered or anything by far. I only told one of the three people about my other potential higher offer situation (this person has big influence to the decision maker, but not directly related to the team that I’ll be working with). She said that the decision maker is a very reasonable guy, so as long as I can proof my higher offer to him, he’d be most likely grant me the salary too. Now, I’m stuck cause company B hasn’t got back to me yet, so I wont have the proof if the guy ever asked a screenshot of my higher offer.

What would you do if you were me? Should I counter the guy at Company A without bringing up Company B’s offer? Or should I still bring it up and just tell him I’m not comfortable to share the screenshot?

If I didnt bring up the other offer to Company A’s decision maker, would it be weird since I already told the lady within the company about my situation? Will they think I’m bluffing?

They look at me like I'm insulting them if I ask them if they know how to coil that mic cable they're holding. Then, they proceed to either wrap it around their forearm or quickly wind it around their hand. Both ways stretch the cable and twist it over and over again.

The proper way to do this is called over-under wrapping. Learn it. Use it. Your cables will last longer and uncoil easily. In fact, when well coiled, a 100-foot cable can be thrown across the room and land in a straight line, without tangles.

Here's a nice how-to from Wired: [http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2013/08/tnhyut-coil-cable/](http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2013/08/tnhyut-coil-cable/)

*Edit:* For those of you about to try this on old cables or garden hoses, make sure you drag it out straight and get all the kinks and twists out. It'll make it easier to tame.

If you are tired of the usual flowers-dinner-candy-card gift idea, here's an idea that would go over well. What moms most want is a personal gift--time with their daughter/son. (This is particularly true if your mother is getting up there in years.)  My suggestion is two-fold:  first, write and send your mom a letter about a week or two ahead of Mother's Day.  Tell her you're tired of the usual gifts and, instead, want to spend time with her and start a new tradition. Tell her you want to take her out for ice cream (or frozen yogurt)! A letter in the mailbox will be a wonderful change from the ever-present bills and junk mail, and the idea of an outing with you will give her something to look forward to as well.  Restaurants are always crowded on Mother's Day but ice cream places usually aren't.  It costs less that a full meal and takes less time, so if you are on a limited budget or time, that would be beneficial as well. Your mom won't feel badly about you spending so much money on her, either. It's all about the time together. If your mom is diabetic, a lot of places offer sugar-free options; you can check that out in advance. By making it a new tradition, you and she get all the above benefits every year, and it saves you the hassle and frustration of trying to figure out what to do for her every year.  You could even include your grandmother (she's a mother too, after all) if she is still capable of joining you.  And, of course, if things are a little tense between you and your mom right now, keep the conversation civil on her special day. Hot button topics are off limits. ",LPT-- Shake things up this Mother's Day and start a new tradition

LifeProTips,/r/LifeProTips/comments/u70w2c/lpt_if_you_see_a_vehicle_accident_and_dont_want/,"LPT background: So my family and I were recently in a very serious head-on fatality collision on a highway. Luckily for us our phones were in our jacket pockets when it happened (second LPT? Don’t keep your phones loose in your vehicle) so when we came to on the side of the highway we were able to call 911. Our car was mangled and we couldn’t get the doors open so we were stuck inside but I could see through my side window as vehicle after vehicle after vehicle passed by us. Seriously there were over like 40 vehicles that passed by us. After getting out of the hospital we were speaking with the police recently and something they said really struck me. The only 911 call placed at all was from us. Not a single person stopped, which I can somewhat understand when it’s dark and icy out, but of all of those vehicles nobody even called 911. If we had been knocked unconscious longer, or if our phones had been wrecked in the crash, we would have been stuck there for who knows how long. My kid probably would have died (he needed emergency surgery), we could have ended up freezing or bleeding out. It was really.... actually quite depressing when I heard that the only people who called it in were us! So the next time you see an accident when driving just play it safe and call it in. You could save a life.

Edit: to clarify I want to state that yes I would much prefer for everyone to go and help if they witness an accident or emergency as well as call 911. That would 100% be preferable. I was just trying to reach the absolute laziest, scared, ambivalent, etc. out there and say if you DON’T stop you should at least call 911. If your countries laws require you to stop at an emergency and help then yes obviously do that.

Edit Again: it’s been brought up that if it’s just a minor thing like a fender bender that calling 911 can be a waste of time and resources. I agree that this can occur and obviously you have to use your judgement (stop and assess if you can as that will help with this) but I still stand by my post that if you don’t know it’s better to err on the side of caution and call.

P.S. thanks for the gold kind stranger!","LPT: If you see a vehicle accident and don’t want to or can’t stop to help, call 911. Even if you think someone definitely must have called 911 already, call 911 anyway. You will probably be the first/only person to call."

LifeProTips,/r/LifeProTips/comments/u6z6ja/lpt_labor_costs_do_not_increase_the_sale_value_of/,"I've seen so many people advertise their used cars increasing the bottom dollar value by adding in parts, and labor. I've had many friends purchase cars, and get ripped off because the owner had shown them a receipt from a shop that included labor.

The bottom line is this: labor will always be a lost expense in the value of a car. If a person puts a new transmission in the vehicle, and that transmission cost $700, and the labor another $700, that person has only invested $700 in the vehicle, and even at that, the cars price does not increase by that full $700.

If you find yourself needing to sink money into a vehicle at a shop that you plan on selling, always consider if it will be cheaper to sell the vehicle broken, or lose money on labor. Those are your two variables. If you are purchasing a used car, and the owner insists on showing receipts with cost of labor plus parts, kindly but firmly inform them the labor adds nothing to the value.

Happy shopping/selling!

Apparently everyone has completely missed the point, and it is quite impossible to combat all the negative comments.

Here it is in simple terms: Labor costs do not equate to a 1:1 on the value of the car. If you paid someone $500 to install $60 worth of parts, the vehicle is not worth an extra $560.

I apologize for trying to give the novice and inexperienced buyers the advise to focus on PARTS and the cost of the actual PART when buying a car that has recently been worked on.

When you find vehicles that have outrageous labor costs to replace inexpensive parts, those are vehicles to stay away from - their design is costly.",LPT: Labor costs DO NOT increase the sale value of a used car.

My friend recently introduced me to Dude Wipes. It's a brand of moist towelettes for men that are flushable. I use the bathroom a couple of times a day and I continuously wipe and wipe and wipe until there is no residue left. Well, every single day before the gym for the past 2 months, I use one of these bad boys. It has made me 100% question how little I knew about wiping my behind. I'm talking having to use 2 or 3 of the wipes to get clean. I find myself now questioning if I did a good job every single time I use the bathroom.

LifeProTips,/r/LifeProTips/comments/u6rpjv/lpt_the_second_best_way_for_guys_to_get_laid/,"I have been reaping the benefits of this since COVID started in 2020 and just now realized I should probably share it. Probably relates mostly to guys who are married or in committed relationships, but whatever. 

The #1 best way to get laid is obviously to be a great, attentive, fun, and enthusiastic partner in bed. Your mileage may vary and this is not the point of this post. 

The next best way to get laid is to be good in the kitchen. You don't have to cook all the meals for the family or even actually be good at cooking, it's the attitude that counts and it works every. single. time.

I will make this very simple. 

Step 1: Once or twice a week, plan a meal and make it all on your own. If it's a weeknight, make a meal for the whole family, or quick easy dish that makes leftovers. If it's a special occasion, make something a little fancier, maybe grab a bottle of wine or make a drink to go along with it, maybe dress it up a little bit? Make whatever you want is what I'm saying. 

Step 2: Actually do the work to make the meal and clean it up. Making a side dish or a sauce or something while she does everything else doesn't count. Use this time to your advantage. Either make it a fun time where you wind down and talk, or let her take some time to herself (working out, running an errand, meeting a friend, etc). Similarly, don't leave a giant pile of dishes in the sink afterwards if you can help it.

Step 3: The most important! Make it very clear that this was something you PLANNED and WANT to do. FORETHOUGHT in this case very quickly turns into FOREPLAY. The details here don't actually matter. This can be a great deal you found to do do a quick meal for everyone, or a recipe you found that you thought she would like, or whatever as long you demonstrate your intention and follow through. Even better, engage in conversation and connect while you make the food. Often times this is an important part of ""catching up"" on the events of the day. I often have my daughter ""help"" me with dinner while my wife jumps on the peloton and does a quick shower. Gives me time to spend with my girl after work while my wife gets a little reset.

Step 4: Profit? WORST case scenario you've got a nice, fresh home cooked meal to enjoy. Sometimes you end up having sex in the kitchen while the food burns in the oven. It's a win win win situation. It even works for days afterwards....like if you made dinner Monday and Thursday, the other nights of the week can be whatever you want. Leftovers, new dishes, eating out, takeout. 

Bonus tips:

\- You don't actually have to be good at cooking. It's really not that hard, I figured it out during a pandemic with an 80hr/wk job and it's not that bad. It's very forgiving and there are always sauces and condiments to cover up mistakes ;) 

\- Get creative with your choices and pick something you like/want to try/know she likes. We don't eat a lot of meat, so sometimes I pick up steaks at the store. For a while I was making my own thai inspired dishes. Once we ate vegan for a month and tried to find interesting recipes. This makes it fun for everyone.

\- Enjoy the process yourself. Along the way I have found favorite recipes, lost weight, and bring great leftovers with me to work the next day (way better than the shitty cafeteria food).",LPT: The Second Best Way for Guys to Get Laid
LifeProTips,/r/LifeProTips/comments/u6rnxv/lpt_looking_to_move_soon_dont_start_looking_at/,"I've had to move around quite a bit, to put it lightly. Left home at around 17, and was lucky to have a friends mom let me pay rent and food stamps to stay with them until I graduated high school. I believe after this next move it will be 10 places (also counting the one place I squatted) that I've lived in a little over a decade. Currently in the process of my 3rd ""planned"" move. The rest were kind of unfortunate living situations that fell apart. And each time I still searched all the sites and apps for places. Every. Single. Time.  Even if I was only in a financial position where I could at best just fill a ""roommate wanted"" need. 

This would often times put me in such a dark place. Knowing that I could very well end up homeless again because of me lacking financial security and also not having any kind of a fall back due to having no family I could rely on. And if you didn't know, trying to accomplish anything while beating yourself up for being irresponsible is a great way to lose all motivation to do what you need to do. 

If you are in a fortunate enough position to be able to plan your move, make sure money will NOT be the last part of the equation you have to solve. It is by far the most difficult to predict, and easily the most stressful step of any of the moves I have done. Now I know sometimes you do have to look for places and figure out the rest later. I've had to look for places while broke, way more times than I care to admit. But if you are in a position to where you PLAN to move, just be sure that you have the money to do so first.

Aeroflot (Russian airline) flight 593 was a famous accident in which a pilot let his son fly the plane. The son accidentally caused the plane to go into a spiral. The pilot then got his son out of the seat and tried to manipulate the plane out of the spiral. However, he instead made the situation worse and the plane crashed. During the investigation that happened after the crash of Russian airline flight 593, it was found out that if the pilot simply let go of controls, the plane would have automatically corrected itself. (Due to the plane's automatic stall protection software, but also because air currents will naturally straighten out the plane) [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeroflot\_Flight\_593](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeroflot_Flight_593)

That's such a great metaphor for life. In situations that you feel extremely bad about and don't know what to do, it's often better to just relax and not try too hard to fix the situation. You can actually cause further damage. The more stressed you are, the more likely that you will overcorrect the situation and lead to other problems.

For example, if you fail a test in a certain subject, and then studied 24/7 on the subject, you might get a good mark on your next test in that subject, but you will have ignored all other subjects and cause marks in those subjects to drop, thus overall doing more damage.","LPT: Many plane crashes happen because pilots were over-reacting, if the pilots simply let go, the plane would have been saved.

LifeProTips,/r/LifeProTips/comments/u6ksw4/lpt_for_any_long_term_services_you_subscribe_to/,"This is meant for things like insurance, banking, credit cards, phone bills, internet, etc. There is no harm in calling up customer service for the services you use, to update yourself of your policies, plans, or profile. Unless of course ""higher than normal call volumes"" means waiting on hold forever. But it's a good practice to remind yourself what you're paying for. Ideally, we would all just know all the details of these services, but things/plans/services change over time.

Call your car insurance company, and ask them some questions about likely scenarios you could see yourself getting in. Call your home/apartment insurance company, and ask what would happen if your home was ever broken into. Call your phone/internet company, and say that you find your bills expensive, and ask if there are any better deals right now. Or ask your phone company, what would happen to my bill if I went on a trip tomorrow and brought my phone and used it like normal? Or ask your internet company, what happens when I go over my data limit? Is it just throttled, or will I accumulate additional charges?

IMO, it's a lot easier to call these companies and ask questions when it's just about getting information. If the wait is too long, just hang up. No big deal.

Double bonus: Aim it at your SO and say you found something hot.

LifeProTips,/r/LifeProTips/comments/u6aeu2/lpt_request_is_asking_for_a_40_raise_too/,"Hey, everyone!

**TLDR**: I have gone above and beyond my job description, my list of responsibilities increased by multiple folds, and I have been considered a high performer. As such, I am preparing to ask for a raise, but I'm stumbling on how much exactly. I am hoping for 40%, but is that too audacious and will they think I'm absurd and avaricious? 

**Bit of a background…**

1. **About me and my contributions to the company**
   1. I have been at this company for almost a year now and I can be considered as a middle manager. In my time here,
      1. my JD has expanded from mainly doing project management to process management.
      2. the number of teams under my remit increased from 4 to 6
      3. having a more active role in supervising people
      4. leading process changes for the entire department and beyond (i.e. not just my teams) 
      5. In saying these four points above, my responsibilities have greatly expanded in a short amount of time and so did my working hours.
2. **Re Company:** This company is doing really well financially and has seen a crazy increase in revenue in the last few years. They also care a lot about their employees and have been actively providing a number of monetary and non-monetary benefits for everyone. They belong in an industry that is flourishing... there is nowhere to go but up for them.
3. **Re my current package:**
   1. I honestly think that my package doesn't match the work that I do. I just need to research this part a bit more and compare industry rates. If anyone knows any good leads on where to begin, that would be fantastic!
4. **Re my point-of-action in getting an increase:** I have already prepared some talk points for my manager:
   1. The reasons I stated above (except about the company part)
   2. The responsibilities I have been doing since day 1 is more than what was marketed in the JD (I do not fault them, because this is a new role for the company. I was in many ways a guinea pig). 
   3. A few examples where I went above and beyond. My key input here is that my impact not only was felt with the teams I directly work with, but also the entire department and beyond.

I am rather confident in getting a raise, because of the pro-employee nature and financial health of the company and because my manager has always been so supportive and has always acknowledged that I have been a high performer.

But… is 40% too much and unheard off? I certainly don’t want to come across as avaricious, but I do think I deserve a substantial raise with all things considered. Also, I am generally fine in not getting the full 40%. But I am still hoping for a 20-30% at the least (which I understand is still on the higher end of the spectrum). I just thought of setting the bar high to make negotiations a bit easier… hopefully.

Thank you and Looking forward to your insights!","LPT Request: Is asking for a 40% raise too audacious, considering (1) my high performance (2) and an increased list of responsibilities?"

This is my very first job and I’m a bit clueless. Please help. 

1) Do you carry a bag to hold a water bottle with you all the time or it’s more convenient to wear a multiple pocket top?

2) Can I ask the owner to use their rubber gloves or I better bring one myself to look more professional and reliable? NOTE: I don’t required to bring anything to the job tho.

3) Should I use a shoes cover when entering the client’s house or should I ask to use their slipper? 

4) How can I manage to clean a house that have 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a living room, kitchen and dining in the efficient way? The task includes change bed sheets, dusting, mirror and glass cleaning, tidying up, door knob, bath tub/shower/ toilet washing, empty trash bins, vacuum and mop for the entire house? 

5) For the 5 hours cleaning job do you bring your own lunch? 

6) I’m only 4’9, is it too short to be an efficient cleaner since I have to clean areas that above me.

7) Any customer service tips?

8) Are there anything else I need to keep in mind?

2. Bread with faux butter - those vegetable oil butters are cheap, full of fat and calories and bread can be stored in a freezer for weeks

3. Cheap veggies - you can usually buy some vegetables very cheaply and they can make a big difference in your diet even if it's once every few days! Eat them raw, add a bit of cheese and it's a meal by itself!

These were specific meals. For a more general advice - go shopping right before preparing a meal and look for groceries that are discounted or near expired to save money. Buying some ground spices like pepper, basil or oregano is also cheap and lasts a long time.

What to avoid - anything that comes in small packaging or anything that doesn't last you the longest time possible. Freezer is your friend if you have it!

LifeProTips,/r/LifeProTips/comments/u6091b/lpt_managers_build_employee_loyalty_to_you_not_to/,"I've been in many managerial roles in my short 35 years of life and I have to say that I have had some of the happiest and most loyal employees ever. The way I accomplished this is simple, I treat employees like people and individuals, not as expendable company assets. Some examples follow:

I make sure that I am the one that picks up the slack if we're short-handed due to sickness. I don't bother someone on their day off, I go in or stay late to cover that gap. 

If they are having a bad interaction with a client, I step in and backup/support/defend my employees. I will never let a customer/client disrespect my employees. I'd rather lose a one time $100 ticket and risk a bad review because I refused service than have an employee that just had someone scream at them for something completely out of everyone's control feel like they are less than human.

I will also send someone home, without them asking, if I can see something isn't right with them(literally saved my front desks marriage because of this). If they can't afford to take that time off because they're out of PTO(or just don't want to use it) I pay their days wages out of my own pocket and make sure they are not worried about losing that money alongside whatever they were stressing over. (I'm sure I've paid at least 5k over the years so employees don't have to worry about meals or bills because I sent them home for a mental health day).

I also keep a full supply of snacks and drinks(out of my own pocket). As well as buying them lunches every week as a thank you. This isn't some generic ""pizza time"" thing, they take a vote and choose what they get. I pay for and drive to pick it up. I currently have an employee who was homeless until recently. The first week I did this with them it drove them to tears. They just got off the streets the last thing they need right now is worrying about meals. So I upped the quality of the snacks to include microwave dinners that they can eat throughout the week.

I never guilt someone that calls out sick(even if I know theyre not sick) into coming in, they need the day for a reason, it's their PTO to use however they want/need. 

Simple things like this make a world of difference. I've been told by my current employees that I am the best manager they've ever had. The quality and quantity of work I receive for these small things is astonishing. Obviously these are what I do. If you can't afford to do the things that require money

The onion also doesn't need to be peeled right away, you can cut it into 2 halves first and then individually peel them. You can also peel the top layer along with an aditional layer, since it saves a lot of time and avoids that weird sticky sublayer. 

If you don't want to cry each time you cut an onion, you can either 1) stand far away from the cutting board (this avoids most but not all crying), or 2) wear anything that fully covers your eyes, such as swimming glasses.

My two cents here, and this is if you have a good car, drive out 100-200 miles away for a mini getaway. It helps your overall mental health too and you can also get better deals on a lot of things.

My process usually goes..

1 - Find a big attraction 50 or 100 miles away, and pick a secondary or smaller attraction adjacent to it. For example, here in California, there is big bear lake, everyone flocks there but people forget there are surrounding staycations, smaller lakes, that are equally better.

2 - Reserve in advance, Airbnb was hard during the pandemic so I call in hotels that charge at least $40-$80 for 2 nights. I call at least 1-2 months in advance.

3 - I make sure my car is filled up, also make some room or space because taxes are cheaper on the outskirts of a big city. I then relax on the first day out, take pictures etc.. Then go to a thrift store or a pet store, even car sales, they're generally a bit cheaper compared to city prices.

As long as I have an emergency kit, extra phone, notified my estranged family members that I'm taking a break from the city, it's generally a pretty cool adventure.

There's definitely nothing wrong going out alone. I used to think and grew to having my SO plan with me. As long as my hotels work, and my car is fully maintained before the trip, it's all smooth sailing. A well maintained car is important, in the US, you can travel almost anywhere as long as you're patient with driving. But generally, my 50-100 mile rule is a good enough experience and they only last 4-5 hours of driving both back home and to the vacation.

As a chronic perfectionist, I've danced around burnout throughout my career. And here's my story of dealing with 3 different burnouts, in various, unsexy ways.

\- The first time - Ineffectiveness: At the very beginning of my carreer, I felt that I was not able to catch up with the needs of the business and questioned my own adequacy.  
✅  How I dealt with it: I immaturely gave in my resignation. Luckily, I had a great &amp; caring manager who encouraged me to reconsider it. So, together, we found ways to gradually build my confidence &amp; competency.

\- The second time - Exhaustion: This time, I had all the confidence I needed to carry out my job. But with ever increasing responsibilities, I found myself at a place of overwhelming workload.  
✅  How I dealt with it: Raised a flag &amp; had a mature conversation with my manager where we re-evaluated our priorities in a strategical way &amp; made reasonable adjustments to our distribution of responsibilities within the team

\- The third time- Cynicism: I felt a very clear, deep &amp; irreconcilable conflict between my values, with that of the organization.  
✅  How I dealt with it: Gave in my resignation in 2 weeks and never looked back.

I don't feel attractive and this is okay - somebody else might think I'm cute.  
I feel boring - others might be interested in what i have to say.  
I will never find somebody to love - I want to love an be loved.

Exercises of mindfulness can help with this. Progress will take time, but it will be sustainable.

LifeProTips,/r/LifeProTips/comments/u55uli/lpt_use_baby_powder_instead_of_dry_shampoo_to_fix/,"The key ingredient in any dry shampoo is an active powder, typically cornstarch, that gives it the ability to absorb oil in the first place. This is why dry shampoos work. 

So its no surprise that cornstarch based baby powders work to fix greasy hair as well. (most baby powders today are cornstarch based) But instead of being in an aerosol can with a [propellant making up 70–90% of its total composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_shampoo#cite_note-US2018153782patent-14), cornstarch baby powder is mainly just *cornstarch*. (And since baby powders must be pediatrician tested, it's safe to assume they are safer and more delicate than products that are not pediatrician tested.)

All you have to do is sprinkle a little bit of baby powder onto the greasy parts of your hair and massage it until its blended with your hands or a brush. Your hair will feel less greasy instantly. It won't make your hair feel sticky or hardened which some dry shampoos tend to do. It also *adds* volume to hair. But what I love most about it is how soft and smooth it leaves hair feeling. Since the powder is so finely grounded, it is able to absorb into the hair extremely well and also extremely *evenly*. It blends into the hair as the powder absorbs the grease, leaving it soft and smooth to the touch, not dry or staticky. 

Also, cornstarch based baby powders aren't all ""baby powder"" scented. They come in a variety of different scents --from unscented to lavender to citrus to floral etc..",LPT: use baby powder instead of dry shampoo to fix greasy hair

Often had a dry mouth and throat, and when I realized I was thirsty? I was *really* thirsty, and [by the time you can feel it, you're already dehydrated](https://www.bcm.edu/news/thirsty-you-are-already-dehydrated). I'm sure others with and without ADHD can relate for various reasons, so here's what I've found works best for me:

When you get out of bed to go to the bathroom, drink an entire bottle of water. Even more if you can stomach it. Whether it's a plastic bottle or, even better, one of those bigger flasks, go for it. If you have medication you take in the mornings, this is probably something you already do with perhaps a small glass but trust me: whole bottle. **The point is to get as much water in you as you can, after all.** (Just don't do too much and make yourself sick. Back before using this method I'd do that often: drinking too much to make up for how dehydrated I felt, and then feeling like garbage for a while.)

Later on, when you have to go to the bathroom again because you drank like a whole bottle of water (and maybe them some)? Do it again, drink a whole other bottle. So *what* if that means going out of the way to refill your flask or grab a bottle out of the pantry or something? You're already up from your seat to go to the bathroom. Might as well take the detour, right? It won't kill you.

And so goes the feedback loop. Drink more water, go to the bathroom more. Go to the bathroom more, drink more water. As long as you're not making excuses to avoid having to do either such as holding it in (which is bad for your bladder) or getting preoccupied between the two acts, you should be able to easily break the cycle of forgetting to hydrate.",LPT: Trouble drinking water throughout the day?

- Decide prior to getting in contact with someone if your personal information will be required. (Name, address, email, phone)

- Answer questions

- Mention if you feel like a part of your concern has not been resolved. 

For explain your issue and expectation:

Burger: This only works for beef products because Chicken and fish is kept for 20 minutes after cooking (often more) So, if you want a fresh Big Mac, all you have to do is ask for something extra or have something out, pickles being a prime choice, burger is cooked to order just for you.

Drink: This only works for cold drinks, If you order a Large coke you get a drink with ice in, If you ask for a coke with no ice, you get a cold drink still as its chilled in the machine, but you'll get more drink in the cup, if not, complain and ask for it to be filled (dont worry about being an asshole)

Our immediate neighbors are quite familiar with our dog and have scooped her up and brought her back on a number of occasions over the years. This time that wouldn't be the case.

My family searched for a solid 3 hours and well into the night around the entire neighborhood to no avail.

My Dad had an idea to hang this huge linen on our tree (which I later added a Google Voice number to). The idea is that the linen is incredibly hard to miss, and grabs your attention more than the average mailbox flyer.

8 days later, someone from way down the street who usually doesn't travel our way saw the big sign and realized the dog they took in was ours.

The next day my Dad changed the sign to a Thank You, and I was surprised with how many people stopped to offer well wishes when I would get out of my car coming home from work. Most of the people I've never seen in my life!

There may be a few residual traces of the burnt matter and the process may need to be repeated once or twice for particularly stubborn burnt-on food. It may also be helpful to let the water soak in for a couple hours or so before freezing as that gives it a chance to further penetrate the burnt stuff.

I live in an area with cold winters and during the winter, I just put the pan outside instead of in the freezer.

Caution: DO NOT do this with seasoned cast iron or pans which have non-stick coatings as the same process which removes the burnt stuff can also remove the coatings. Also, a half inch of water is generally all that is necessary and will freeze much faster.

I was with a woman I knew since high school. We had a big group of friends and every weekend was a party somewhere. She wasn’t perfect as far as a partner goes. I’m bisexual but never acted on it. After a third time of her cheating on me or me catching her trying to cheat or whatever I acted on my feelings and cheated on her and got caught. It ended our relationship and while I necessarily don’t regret it, I’m with that guy now.

When things went down and we divorced I guess I feel like I lost all those friends too. I am not open about my relationship now and hide it from coworkers and everyone else except my parents and siblings. I haven’t really had any kind of connection to any of my old friends. This has gone on for years now with me pretty much going no contact with my old friends. I’m from a small town and people talk. I know of at least  one friend that is aware of the fact that I’m with a guy now and he’s made that clear to me and extended an invite to come around and hang out but I’ve never took him up on that. From what he said it’s clear some others do know but I’m not sure how many other friends know my situation now or to what extent or what any of them even think I’m doing now or if they even care. I stay away from any interactions with any of my old friends cause I guess I don’t know what they know or how they would react. I feel like with how I know how people talked about people behind their backs and about what they were up to and stuff when I was in the clique some do know and some may not.

LifeProTips,/r/LifeProTips/comments/u4lcy4/lpt_gargling_with_water_is_one_of_the_best_ways/,"I come from a family with bad teeth. 
All my sibling have rotten teeth. Both my parents had rotten teeth and now both are wearing full dentures. At an early age i started showing signs of bad teeth. I have tooth gap on either side. I lost my two front teeth in high school and had to wear an ill-fitting denture with metal hooks. I have teeth filled with filling.

I wasn't really happy with the dentures because it's too obvious and lose. I had to replace it after just a few months. Then later on, I leveled up and had crowns on my front teeth. This time more secured than the dentures but still obvious because you could see the hollowed gum above the dentures and one time one of my crowns fell and i had to glue it myself. 

Then one time I saw an advert about dental implants. Then I had an epiphany! I worked and worked and saved money and after a year or two i was able to save enough money to afford 2 dental implants. It's fixed and super secured. I have been wearing them for almost 20 years now. Same colour as my other teeth, no hollowed gums (bones regrew), i can drink hot and cold, bite on any food without fear of breaking it, so i pretty much have my two front teeth back. 

But this is where the gargling comes -
after I had the implants, because they cost me arm and leg, i vowed to take care of my teeth from then on no matter what. I never ever skip brushing my teeth with one exception, when i fly long-haul. I only clean by gargling. I only brush my teeth in the morning and evening. I would gargle after every meal, every snack, and even longer everytime I drink fizzy drink! Always gargle for about 30 sec to a minute or longer.

That's the secret why I halted the eventual death of my teeth. Gargling with water for at least 30sec. I started brushing my teeth at an early age without fail and yet i still lost 4 teeth. But the powerful effect of gargling made a huge difference. I have healthier teeth now and never had any toothache for seveal
decades now.",LPT: Gargling with water is one of the best ways to protect your teeth

Long story short: traveling internationally but my daughter’s passport is stuck in an agency in SC. 3 months back, the agency had mailed it to a wrong address and it had remained stuck there all this time.

Called an agent yesterday and she posted a note with information about what had gone wrong.

Called again right back… still the same “can’t do nothing, can’t see nothing “ attitude.

Called in a third time again. This new agent Howard told me right away that the agency had entered a new tracking number in lieu of mailing the passport.

LifeProTips,/r/LifeProTips/comments/u4165s/lpt_what_to_prepare_for_a_trade_show/,"There are some things that are essential in a trade show that can make your booth more impressive.

**Canopy tent**. Generally speaking, trade shows are held indoors, but many exhibitors still choose to bring them with them. Because some venues do not have baffles for individual companies, a canopy tent can separate your display from the exhibitors next to you. It also gives a display space. If you want to be more personalized, you can put your logo on the canopy, which is more impressive. A tall pop-up canopy can stand out in the crowd and attract attention. 

**Banners and posters**. These two items are essential and they are the easiest way to showcase your brand or product. They are eye-catching, convey your message, and as the pop up canopy, are recyclable and can be used in multiple trade shows. If you have enough budget, you can also make your brand into a brochure for distribution, which will help visitors understand the product features in more detail.

**Stationery**. Besides paper and pencil, bring all kinds of supplies that you may need. **Scissors, business cards, tape, sticky notes, garbage bags, etc.** In a crowded trade show, these small items may be a lifesaver.

**Snacks and water**. The trade show is very busy and you will find little time to rest. Bring a simple snack to keep your energy up, and bottled water with a brand logo on it to hand out to people coming to your booth. This is also a way to promote your business.

 **Decoration**. Bring a tablecloth and some portable decorations.

This alone works wonders, but it's not enough to make TRUE movie theater popcorn. Also you need VERY little of it, follow the guides o the back.

You also need [Butter Flavored Oil](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AXK9ROC/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1). Not only do you **COOK** the popcorn in this oil, but it **ALSO** serves as the buttery topping that you find in theaters. A couple tablespoons per 1/4 cup of popcorn seed over a medium heat, stirring vigorously (I use a wok myself). Top it however you prefer: a little on the top, layered, or not at all.

Yup, that's the true secret. There's no actual butter, just butter flavoring and seasoning salt. I have personally tested both those products above, and they are the real deal.

If you’re storing healthy food options on the bottom shelf of your fridge, or if you’re placing them behind larger items, you’re putting yourself at a disadvantage when you’re hungry or thirsty. You want something quick to snack on but at the same time your brain wants to make the quickest decision possible to avoid being hungry or thirsty any longer. Thus it’s more likely you will default to what’s immediately in view, rather than the healthier alternative.

I started keeping things like baby carrots, hummus, and bags of grapes in the top shelf of the fridge and in front of other things. That made such a big and immediate difference to my habits and I found myself eating them much more frequently!

And the reverse is also true for unhealthy items. In my pantry, I began placing bags of chips and soda cans towards the back and hidden behind other items.

Conspiracy of the Megalodon.

There are many people today who still believe or perpetuate the idea that the extinct shark such as the Megalodon still exists, mainly on YouTube or some web forums. They will usually provide grainy or poor quality footage or photos to back up their claims. In order to quickly debunk this, all you need to do is remember and apply CEMS.

Climate - The Megalodon was a shallow or coastal water hunter. Look at the climate of the photo, does the climate look like a shallow or coastal area? Is it too deep, too warm or too cold? If so, then it probably isn't Megalodon. If the climates differentiate between different examples of footage or photo then it probably isn't the same sort of shark.

Eyes - The people or believe or perpetuate these myths will often provide numerous examples of imagery or footage. Look at the eyes of the shark. Are they different to eachother? Is it a black pit (such as Mako sharks or \[Great\] White sharks) or is there also sclera (colour) in the eyes (such as Lemon, Woebegone, Greenland and Sleeper sharks)?

Markings - If numerous examples of shark photos or footage are provided then it's also handy to look at the markings or colour of the sharks. Are they different colours or have different markings? Is one shark grey with brown stripes or is another brown with grey stripes? If so, they are definitely not the same shark. Do note that sharks often become duller in colour as they age.

Shape - Is the shape different between the sharks? Does one have a pointy nose while the other have a blunter nose? Is one longer or short than the other? Are the dorsal, pectoral or tail find bigger of one shark or smaller than the others sharks'? If so, then they also may not be the same shark.

So, in order to debunk some (not all) of the myths surrounding this fascinating creature, all you need to do is remember CEMS:  
Climate  
Eyes  
Markings  
Shape

They aren't always hiring, but most will have you put your name on a list, or take an aptitude test. Some of the benefits of being in a union are:

* Only require high school diploma or GED
* Guaranteed hourly wage, along with guaranteed raises yearly (depending on the contract)
* Contracts between the workers and the employers that guarantee fair wage practice
* If work is slow in your specific area, you can transfer between local unions once your apprenticeship is over.
* Most Unions have some type of pension plan or retirement credits that you earn as you work; these are better than a 401k (IMO) as they aren't as tied to the stock market.

An example of what I'm talking about here is that I used to make my husband a cup of coffee and bring it to him every morning.

At first, this bothered me, how could he not appreciate this nice, loving gesture and getting fresh coffee served to you in the morning?

I also noticed that I was organizing a lot of light social events at work - birthday lunches, holiday parties, happy hours, etc. People would come but nobody ever really made a point to say that they appreciated I was doing it.

**Example**

Let's say you want to divide 270 by 5. Multiply 270 by 2, which is (540). Now, move one decimal place to the left. It should be (54.0), which is (54). So, 270/5 is 54.

289 divided by 5. Multiply 289 by 2, which is (578). Move one decimal place to the left and it's (57.8).

I need to address some things.

Having just spent about a few months trying to make a surprisingly comfortable air mattress work, but then giving up and exchanging it for some cheap memory foam pads, allow me to make the case that you should probably stop buying air mattresses and simply buy individual memory pads that are now available as low as $40 in about every big-box store. 

Besides that memory foam padding is cheaper than ever:

* Takes about 5 inches of foam padding for a full grown &lt;200lb man to feel comfortable on any surface. (Walmart sells them in 1, 2 and 3 inches, about $120 to build out 5"") 
* Can't be popped.
* Quickly and easily folded for transport, and cannot be ruined in transport by poor storage (being memory foam and all).
* After temporary use, can be converted to permanent use on your own bed or even cut into pieces and made into padding for chairs, car, etc.
* Might take work but it comes it different types and firmnesses so there are some options available.

For contrast, an air mattress:

* Basically guaranteed to spend $100+ for anything worth buying because anything cheaper won't last a weekend; easily upwards of $300 for the ones with reasonable assurances of durability.
* Literally guaranteed to pop with any regular use (read the usage warnings, always says ""Don't use regularly"").
* Essentially guaranteed to pop if used by any adult especially for any adult reasons.
* Can be patched but ironically never with patches provided.
   * Also patching only postpones the inevitable next patch.
      * Pro-tip tho: Use a 2-part epoxy for plastics for patching air mattresses. Non-specific clear/translucent type also worked equally well, but dark hard setting one failed completely.
* Takes way longer to pack up and must be packed carefully or risk damage.
* Only other option for type of air in an air mattress is to I guess fart into it? I dunno, that's between the mattress and you.

It can take a couple of weeks for your body to adjust to major seasonal changes in temperature and humidity and reach a healthy equilibrium. During this transitionary period, your body may be producing excess mucus, which can then lead to sinus infections and sore throats from post nasal drip.

A lot of people further exacerbate the problem by taking all sorts of cold medicines such as Sudafed and antihistamines, which dry out the sinuses and help temporarily. Your sinuses react to the dryness by pumping out even MORE mucus, though, so you can end up in a vicious cycle for weeks.

The best thing you can do for a cold or seasonal shift is to hydrate your sinuses with an isotonic saline spray. DON’T use medicines that dry you out! If you use an isotonic saline spray (such as arm and hammer saline spray), your sinuses will stop producing excess mucus because they are properly hydrated. The salt content also acts as a sterilizing “preservative” that makes the environment unfriendly towards bacteria.

✅ Create and sustain meaningful relationships with other people.

✅ Find your passion and immerse yourself into it

✅ Learn about things that interest you. Develop a skill or a hobby.

✅ Help those who are less fortunate than yourself.

It's ok to vote for someone you don't completely agree with just so that the other party/candidate that you completely disagree with doesn't get more seats/say in your government.

By voting, you decrease the number of radicals in power in your country, here's an example:

100 seats in the Senate

In all of the population, radicals get 3% of the vote, but all of their supporters go vote. That would be 3 seats in the Senate if the threshold was 3%)

If 50% of the population goes to vote, the radicals get 6% of the votes cast  which means 6 seats (that actually might be the only reason they are present in the Senate with 5% minimum threshold)  


And generally, the more votes are cast on one party, the other party that you despise gets fewer seats in the Senate. (even if they meet the threshold for being in the Senate)

When it comes to giving advice, sure, you can do that, but unless you checked all the 3 boxes I mentioned in the title, it is probably more respectful to stay quiet.

I'll explain why it is a bad idea to express you opinion in all situatons mentioned:

\-""don't give anyone advice if you don't know the details of their situation"" - this is especially true for medical issues. For example: if you had acne and a specific treatment worked for you that doesn't mean it's going to work for everyone. Your suggestion could make their acne worse if they don't have it due to the same cause.

\-""you aren't knowledgeable on the subject"" - I don't think this one needs a lot of explanation. Maybe an adult would just ignore you, but if you are much older, like a 40 year old advising a 16 year old, you could just give terrible advice to someone who would likely follow it because they would assume you are older and more knowledgeable. For example: Telling someone tanning is good for their acne. Someone who would say that not only doesn't know about acne, they don't know much about skin care skin general.

\-""you aren't sure they actually want your advice"" - If you don't know if they even want your advice you may come off as arrogant, rude or end up insulting them, especially if you didn't check the other boxes. For example: telling a woman who works out to stop working on x body part so much because it looks too big or muscular when she didn't ask for you opinion. That woman can see herself in the mirror. That is even more rude if you didn't check the other boxes, because you don't know how she want to look, how she looked before, what are the her problematic spots, what work out routine she has. She may may have looked like that from the start or maybe that is her goal look.","LPT: don't give anyone advice if you don't know the details of their situation, you aren't knowledgeable on the subject and aren't sure they actually want your advice."

Trying to tell people how has always been a challe so i will just tell my story and hope for the best. Side note, if you dont read this with a COMPLETE open-mind and not and INCH of judgement, you wont understand how i want you too.
Ok so i was born in new york to two African and also muslim parents, who were both strict. I spent my elementary years in a hood in Memphis,Tn, the #1 ranked most dangerous city for so many years. And ive always LOVED anything revolving around people expressing themselves, mainly music, art, and movies. Movies are the base of my personality, i loved movies and series so much as a kid i use to randomly switch my personalities and habits to i guess prepare myself to be an actor. But it stuck with me.I lived in the hood but hated all the hood behaviors, like killing and rap music.

See then the start of my middle school happened and i moved to the safer more suburban part of the city. I was around smarter kids like myself, that i could have really intelligent and meaningful conversations with but never about struggle and “hood” shit, and this maybe ironic but i started loving my hood side more, and i showed it more, but my personality was still changing and becoming similar to the “rich” kids.. 

Now comes my favorite years, the beginning of high school. All of my life i was an extroverted person , but in 9th grade I completely changed teams,( probably because i started smoking more weed). Anyways, instead of saying what came to my mind and doing what my body felt, i just sat and analyzed people, but not in the judgmental way, i knew that would only lead me to become a hateful person. Instead i felt the need to understand why people think and behave the way they do. I cant say all my notes because we’d be here all day, but my conclusion was, EVERY LITTLE DETAIL to the TINIEST SMALLEST DETAIL that happens to a person, such as the people they meet, the conversations they have and the experiences they go through. All these things make up peoples habits, and that makes up our personality. Nobodys right or wrong for anything they do , we all are just what life has molded us to be in our specific circumstance.

Finally, my favorite part, how i started living and being happy. When i started to realize this i wouldnt say theres an exact moment where i just “dropped out” i just stopped going to school. Now judge all you want, but in my opinion, yea elementary school is important so you know how to count and become social and other certain things, but high school? Ok look , you only need good grades and a diploma if you want to get into a good college, which gets you a “good” job , with a stable life. Im sorry but my mind screams at the idea of doing the same thing every single day, staying in the same city every day, or even being around the same people every day. Theres WAY too many places to visit, people to meet and love, and too many experiences too make. 
Im 17 now, and i dont live with any rules to live or love.(not meaning i go around breaking the law) i just dont follow by societal rules. I say yes to whatever, i talk to as many strangers as i can, i fall in love with almost every girl (and some guys☺️) i meet, and my favorite, i wake up every day not knowing what country i might end up in , or what girl i might be crying over, in the end, i live without regrets, i only get one chance at this, and theres only been one me EVER, so fu** how society thinks i should live, im gonna be the me-est me in the history or all galaxies. Yolo i wish you all the happiest , love-filled lives",LPT: How to let go of how society thinks you should be happy.

This article is a review of the research in this area written for lay audiences. So this is a summary of the summary (for details and examples see the article):

To make waiting **easier**:

1. Distract yourself.  
2. Do not make big decisions in a need state (e.g., feeling hungry, exhausted, in pain). 
3. Pre-commit to being patient.  
4. Use reminders for the steps you must take to receive the reward for which you are waiting.  
5. Put yourself in a positive mood. 
6. Reframe the thing you are waiting for in a way that reduces its emotional appeal.  

To make waiting more **desirable**:

1. Wait before making a choice (“wait-to-choose technique”).
2. Increase your level of certainty and trust, the belief that you will receive the reward if you are patient. 
3. Improve the personal connection to your future self—the self who will benefit from your patience. 
4. Change how the options are framed, so the delayed outcome appears more valuable.",LPT: You can increase self-control by making easier to wait but also more desirable to wait.

So they asked her in the waiting room of the doctor's office for her first and last name, her DOB, the last four of her SSN, and even asked out loud to confirm her street address. 

Someone in the waiting room playing on their phone also happened to write this down. Her identity was stolen!!!! It took YEARS to recover from that.

Always ask for a piece of paper to write it down and make sure you get it back! I always bring my own pen and paper to write it down. 

Something similar happened to my best friend once too, it was not even at a doctor's office but at the car mechanics where they asked her to confirm her phone number and street address out loud and an admirer took this as an open invitation to call her and send her gifts to her address. 

Also FYI, when going to any place where you are using their services it's totally okay to ask WHY they need all this information of yours. Most ridiculous policies usually require all this personal information to use their services. (Like date of birth for dry cleaning, really??) 

That's why I have a dummy phone number (Google voice, it's free!) Dummy emails (instant email address from the app store, free!) and for places that do not accept P.O boxes as an address, if it is that important to you for an extra fee you can upgrade to a business P.O box which then appears as an actual street address and no P.O box number.

LifeProTips,/r/LifeProTips/comments/u21uvr/lpt_you_cant_buy_attraction_expensive_dinners_and/,"A common Nice Guy misconception is that over-the-top demonstrations of romance or devotion are the way to a woman’s heart. This falls in line with the false portrayal from movies and romantic comedies of how attraction works in the real world.

Leagues don’t exist. However, when a guy feels that a woman is ‘out of his league’, or if he doesn’t have a dynamic personality, he believes he has to prove his worth by buying things for her. It’s a crutch.

This almost always never works. 

Showering a woman with gifts before any type of relationship has been established puts too much pressure on things, and will often have the opposite effect of what was originally intended.

This is because the gesture isn’t authentic. The belief that doing X,Y,Z for someone in return for their affection is incredibly disingenuous. Women can sense this, and it puts them on guard. They know there is an implied expectation from the other person for their affection. This would make anyone uncomfortable.

Instead of focusing on buying things, focus on experiences and having fun, and bonding. 

This doesn’t mean you should necessarily take her to a dive or a fast food place, but if the chemistry is there, you two will have fun regardless where you are. It could be as simple as getting a pizza and going for a walk, playing pool, or grabbing a drink.

I went home and looked at the original contract and the contract they had me re-sign and noticed several differences that I didn't notice before because my payment was the same and, due to our friendly conversation, I was admittedly distracted, trusted him, and didn't read the new contract because my payment was exactly the same.

What the dealership had done was originally financed my car through the dealership for a lower interest rate, then changed a lot of the finance numbers to ensure that everything matched for me in the short term (i.e. my monthly payment) but my interest rate jumped three percent, I assume the commission for the salesman had jumped, and they sold my contract to another finance company. The numbers inside the contract including the final sale price of the car, the trade in of my car, additional warranty for mechanical issues, the gap coverage, and other miscellaneous dealership fees had changed dramatically to suit the needs of the finance contract to ensure that they could get the financing. I'm now getting the paperwork from the finance company to ensure that what the dealership sent them matches what they gave me.

TL:DR - Don't sign anything without reading everything first, and get all changes in writing which highlights all changes before signing a new contract from any dealership.

Edited to remove an assumption on commission.

Edit 2 for clarification - The dealership informed me during the first signing that I was approved through one finance company and had me sign the contract, and idiotically (my fault admittedly, while letting the guy talk to me through the signing and not paying attention to what I was reading,) what I was actually signing was financing through the dealership. The ""error"" was that in the 12 days between the first and second signing, they had actually sold my contract from their dealership to the finance company that I was already approved for (or that they had informed me I was approved through.) So, the second contract was the exact same form as the first, but the interest rate, many of the numbers were different, as well as the finance company had changed from the dealership to the finance company they had already informed me I was approved through.","LPT: If you buy a new car, and the dealership calls and says there's an issue with the contract and you need to come back and re-sign, do not do it until you have them send you the new contract and mark all the changes."

LifeProTips,/r/LifeProTips/comments/u1t74z/lpt_what_did_i_do_wrong/,"I recently was released from jail after 5 months. I was charged with 2 counts of violating a restraining order misdemeanor and a stalking felony. This was my first time ever being in trouble with the law besides a past dwi. I have also never been to jail before.

I’ve been struggling with depression for years. In 2020 it started getting worse at a quicker pace. My depression was mainly due to loneliness and a lack of life. My work life was a big part of my life. I had been working at a warehouse in 2020 and quit working there in February of 2021. I loved working there, I loved the people that worked there. They were very important to me.

I got a job at another warehouse across the street. Shortly after starting there I was leaving work one day and one of my co workers from the previous warehouse pulled out in front of me. Her and I take the same way home. After getting on the highway I decided to mess with her and I trailed behind her and rode her car for a couple of minutes on the highway. What I did was wrong and I am ashamed of it. I didn’t mean no harm I was just goofing around but of course that in no way changed the fact that it was wrong.

She immediately filed a restraining order against me. Her and I got into quite a few arguments while working together but she was still one of my favorite people at that job and Our time working together meant a lot to me. 

The month leading up to our court date my depression started getting worse and worse and I started having suicidal thoughts. Everyone else I worked with there cut me off. I reached out for help telling them I was sad and depressed and that I was sorry for what I did. I care so much about the people in my life and that was my favorite job I’ve ever had. I told her I couldn’t handle seeing her in court and that it would destroy me mentally.

After seeing her in court that day I couldn’t stop crying and I felt so alone and worthless. The next day I woke up and decided I was going to kill myself. I started drinking and started cutting myself up. I had never cut myself before so I started drinking a lot of alcohol to numb my body and ended up getting pulled over and charged with a dwi.

After this my depression got worse and worse and I eventually started having suicidal thoughts everyday, it consumed me. It wasn’t something I thought about just once or twice it was all day long. Everyday after work I sit at home and cry alone in the dark. I wanted to kill myself because it was the only way to stop feeling sad. I just wanted the pain to go away so badly.

After feeling this way for months I couldn’t handle being sad anymore. It’s not you experience severe depression that you can understand it, there’s no greater pain. I had been in and out of the hospital almost ten times in the 4 months for cutting myself up during this time. I reached out to her and also emailed other people that worked there with me because I knew the only way I could get better was if they reassured me they didn’t hate me.

I just wanted them to care about me. It made me so sad to think they hate me. I told her and them that I had been struggling and I just wanted to know they didn’t hate me and that I was sorry. I’ve always been told when your sad and suicidal that you should reach out for help and talk to someone so I did. I messaged them multiple times, a lot, but I was very very depressed and I was having a mental breakdown.

I never once said anything threatening or hateful or never once threatened to kill myself if they didn’t respond. I was going kill myself ina couple days so as a last effort I went to her house just to ask her to please reassure me they didn’t hate me and to please help me. I walked up to her outside and said hey. She ran past me and called the cops. She and everyone else I worked with gave my messages and emails I sent to the cops.

They arrested me a couple days later. I have never been violent or been in a fight in my life.  I’m the kind of person that spends all day watching pug videos because they’re adorable or listening to Ed Sheeran. I would never hurt a fly I’m just a sensitive and depressed person. Btw everyone there loved working there with me and I ended things on good terms which is why this hurt me so much.

I went to jail for 5 months. I wasn’t given a bond. She showed up during the bind hearing and said that I gave her ptsd and traumatized her for life. That if I got out she would continue to live in fear. She said these things because she hates me. I only ever asked her to please help me. Being in jail for 5 months was the worst experience of my life. I cried myself to sleep Eveyday and it destroyed me mentally.

I understand that it was wrong of me to violate a court order and that it was wrong to message someone that didn’t want me to but I was in so much pain and just needed someone to talk to. If they would’ve just said we don’t hate you that would’ve saved me. The courts/judge/prosecutor treated me like I was a dangerous criminal because of my mental health and because I had been cutting myself.

The courts/judge/prosecutor didn’t care at all about me or my mental health they only cared about her. I matter to. My mental health and life matter too. I’m only human I make myself but I’ve never hurt or threatened anyone in my life and there were people with violate crimes who got bonds and who were repeat offenders but I was forced to sit for 5 months.

My probation is a 5 year probation. I can’t drink alcohol or smoke for 5 years. I have to live with my parents for 5 years. I have other requirements too. I was already struggling before but now all of this and I lost my job that I loved so much. I owe my lawyer and other ppl 10000 plus dollars.

I understand that some of the things I did was wrong but I just needed help. I was hurting myself physically. It’s not wrong to care about people and there opinions of you. It’s not wrong to reach out for help when your sad and scared your going to kill yourself. They all blocked me on social media and ignored me before and it makes me so sad.

Did I deserve all of this? I feel like my life is over after the probation and losing my job. But even more importantly it makes me so sad that they didn’t care about the pain I was in.

LifeProTips,/r/LifeProTips/comments/u1sicl/lpt_request_how_to_tell_the_difference_between/,"My body, and in turn my mind, does not seem to be able to tell the difference between the two... and it sucks. 

Things I should be excited for - upcoming concerts, trips away, nice social events, seeing friends and family - is wrapped up in anxiety and stress. Things that are exciting-yet-also-stressful - like starting a new job - are even worse.

It's really hard to enjoy anything. And then I'm so anxious about doing the said thing that I'm a ball of nerves by the time I get there and find it hard to enjoy myself. I'm quite intuitive as well so psych myself out wondering if these bad feelings are my intuition warning me of something.

I've done all manner of MH therapies in the past (for various reasons) and as such I'm well versed in recognising the root cause of my worries and challenging my thoughts and feelings through CBT reframing. 

But I just can't shake this, or train my body/mind to discern between excitement and anxiety. It's been like this for as long as I remember (although the added fear of catching Covid whilst out really doesn't help), and it's got worse as I've got older and I'm now at a point where its really getting me down. And it's taking a toll on my body and drains me of energy even quicker.

The hardest part of putting new sheets on your bed is trying to get the duvet back in its cover without it getting all bunched up inside. When someone suggested I use binder clips, it was like an epiphany. Just go to any store that sells stationary and you’ll find them. Get the biggest ones they have (and get at least 4). Then use this technique:

1) lay duvet cover flat on the bed in the correct orientation (usually the hole is at the bottom), and stand at the foot of the bed

2) find one of the short edges of the duvet and stuff it in

3) reach inside, grab one of the corners of the duvet and start pulling the cover towards you until you get one corner in the right place, and clip it with a binder clip

4) repeat for the other corner, don’t forget the clip

5) stuff the rest of the duvet in, and once the other two corners are inside, line them up and clip them too

6) now that all four clips are in place, grab the edge nearest you, and start flapping the whole thing up and down until it’s laying flat (careful that the clips on the far side don’t hit anything fragile)

7) remove clips. Done!

I thought it would be a good time to pay it off, as I wasn't going to return the phone and see what I could get for a phone plan with no contract (as I was paying about $150/month for my previous contract).

I paid my outstanding balance and called customer service and spoke with a guy for 20 minutes and he said he found a plan with 10 GB data, unlimited talk/text/picture SMS for $60/month (CAD) but because I paid the balance that day, I would have to call back the next day after the payment processed.  I said thank you and hung up.  (I did ask what my typical monthly usage was and it was around 7-8 GB, as I'm always on Wi-Fi at home because that's where I work 90% of the time).

Things went sideways quickly the next day...

The agent let's me know that the best we can do is 25 GB unlimited talk/text/picture SMS for $85/month.  I said, please check the notes, because I had asked the previous day's rep to record this on the file.  They checked the notes and said I'm sorry sir, this is the best we can do.

I was not happy and asked to speak to the loyalty department.  They offered me the same plan.  I got mad and started checking the competitors (Big 3 carriers in Canada) and they all have the same plan, no matter who you are.  I said what kind of 'loyalty' reward is this? I've been with this carrier for over a decade (in fact 14 years and 8 months I was just told).

Again they replied it was the best they could do, and I told them that they basically did the classic ""Bait &amp; Switch"" and I was ready to file a formal complaint with the CRTC.

Fast forward to today and someone from the Executive Center says you know what, we'll take care of you and give you the 10 GB plan, unlimited talk/text/picture SMS and your monthly bill will be $50/month.

Had they never mentioned the $60/month plan, I wouldn't have been mad, but the fact that they did mention it and then 'magically' couldn't find such a plan is what irritated me the most.  They did the right thing and I accepted their apology and thanked them for doing so.

Nb: it won’t work if ur not fully motivated to quit. You need to really have a desire to quit whatever addiction or habit - since u came here u prolly are quite motivated…

———————————

Step 1) you pick a date for smoking ur last cigarette/eating ur last burger or what ever tf u wanna do. The date has to be in the near future.. like within a week or so. This is to make sure that ur still motivated. 

Step 2) on the last day when u go to bed (after u threw out all evidence of that shitty habit like an ashtray or a whine bottle) you have to make sure ur not too tired. You need to spend a little time in ur head creating ur new mindset/mind hack. 

Now u gotta get a little creative or imaginative!! Its a little out there, but just try it out…

Step 3) imagine that there is a little person male or female living in ur mind. This person should be a tiny version of urself. Not just any You, but the You that u really WANT to be. He/she can be fit AF or have super clean lungs or… u get the idea. 

The person lives in a house in which ever surroundings you decide. The only criteria - and this is very important - is that near the person’s house there is a cliff or a giant hole. 

This hole is black and endless. Anything that goes in the hole dissappears forever and CANNOT return. It litterally falls out through the back of ur head and is forgotten. 

Step 4) now you have to specify the rule or change you want to live by. My rule was for example “you cannot smoke anymore”. 

Tomorrow when ur new and improved life begins all thoughts that contradicts ur rule are thrown into the dark black hole u have created. Even thoughts that revolves around ur old habit are illegal and goes in the black hole. 

To do this you get help from the person in ur mind. The heathy you. The real you. 

EVERYTIME a thought enters your mind and it revolves around ur old habit or addiction imagine ur person catching that thought in a little bucket he/she has (or wheel barrow or sumthing) he/she runs to the giant black pit of nothingness and throw the thought down the hole. 

This happens EVERYTIME you think about ANYTHING relating to your old habbit. 

Step 5) you must accept that your person must run fast in the first couple of days as you might be having withdrawls, but thats okay because that person (the tiny You) is strong and can handle it. 

As the days go by, pay attention to how the little person has to do less work as fewer illegal thoughts enter your mind.

In a week he/she might only have to go to the black hole 20 or 10 or 5 times a day.

At some point he/she wont have to go at all.

U can use it to work out more as well. For example create a rule like “I will work out three times a week” and every thought contradicting that is illegal. “Urh I dont wanna work out today” would for example be illegal.


So yeah that’s the method I have been using. Now I came up with this myself and I’m not a psychologist or any expert so there is prolly better ways out there. This just worked for me which is why I wanted to share it with anyone who might find it helpful. 

Let me know if it works. Or if you have any questions.

LifeProTips,/r/LifeProTips/comments/u1dfou/lpt_if_you_ever_find_yourself_dreaming_about/,"“How could you leave your secure job at a great company?”  
“What made you find the courage to take the leap?”  
 

Everybody believes that quitting your job to pursue what you are passionate about takes guts.  
 

But the succesful ones all know that if you validate your offer before you leave your job, it is actually easier to take the leap than not to.  
 

Every great ambition seems impossible when you first envision it. But as you strive towards it, a sense of possibility takes you over. And further down the road, there comes a tipping point where it becomes objectively more preferrable to your starting point. This is The Law of the Inevitable.  
 

Herre are 10 proven steps that will get you from impossible to inevitable:  
 

1) Dream big. If it doesn’t seem impossible at first, you aren’t dreaming big enough.  
 2) Learn. Explore. Ask. Immerse yourself into that idea &amp; the world surrounding it  
 3) Start playing around. Create drafts. Brainstorm. Don’t kill anything yet. It’s more about having fun than getting tangible results at this stage.  
 4) Create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). For a writer, it could be a blog post or a lead magnet. For an app, it could be a simple landing page.  
 5) Bring your MVP to the market. Get actual feedback from your real prospects. You don’t have to charge them yet. You are testing whether there is an interest or not.  
 6) Tweak. Adjust. Polish. Re-test it.  
 7) Launch time!  
 8) Measure. Observe. Hypothesize.  
 9) Pivot, if needed. It’s the destination that matters, not where you started.  
 10)  Voila… You are there.  
 

Remember: It always seems impossible until it’s done.

What do I mean exactly? I mean that if you're looking to add a topping to a food item, before you do so and spend that extra $2-$3 try and look at other menu items, and see if you can get the same product for a cheaper price.

To add onto that, DO NOT get ""make your own"" option when ordering food, because 90% of the time, you could just customize another menu item, and get the same thing for a cheaper price.

I class this as a life pro tip, simply because I see way too many customers making really dumb choices when it comes to ordering, and sometimes even paying double the price for something.

Here's a couple of ones I personally know from working in a NZ Dominos:

Want a way cheaper garlic prawn? Take a veg trio, change the base to cremé fraiche and add the base garlic swirl. Take off the mushroom, and add prawns. Bam! You've saved like $4 

Want a cheesy garlic pizza with pepperoni? Instead of adding pepperoni to a cheesy garlic and paying like $7 for the whole thing, take a pepperoni pizza, change the base to cremé fraiche with a garlic swirl and add oregano which might I add, IS FREE. Bam! You've saved $1

Want a cheaper double bacon cheeseburger? Take a beef and onion, take out the onion and add bacon and a mayo swirl. Bam! You've saved $2

And Jesus fucking Christ, if you have half a brain do not straight up order any of the chicken pizzas as is.

This is absolutely true. Whether it’s the mammalian diving reflex or a release of epinephrine, if you are tired and groggy, cold water to the face will immediately snap you out of it. 

The problem is it requires way too much mental effort. Getting up, going to the bathroom, then willing yourself to turn the cold tap and splash away is tough, particularly for those of us who are the heaviest sleepers. How to overcome this? Use a spray bottle beside your bed. 

Now here’s the real secret to making this work. You need the water to be cold enough to induce the physical reaction. But leaving water out overnight will just result in lukewarm room temperature nothingness. How to overcome this?

Freeze the water in the spray bottle, then let it thaw overnight. 6-8 hours later you will have a cold spray bottle full of life giving, alarm clock beating, wake up juice. Spritz spritz and bam!

LifeProTips,/r/LifeProTips/comments/u168nv/lpt_15_years_repairing_electronics_here_with/,"I've spent nearly 20 years repairing liquid/water damaged electronics. More specifically, cell phones. In the old days, we'd open the phones up, clean the corrosion, resolder, etc. Recently, they've (the manufacturers) moved away from local repairs and moved more towards warranty replacements, swap outs (FRU = factory replacement units) &amp; insurance. Now if you want your electronics repaired locally, you have to visit 3rd party independent people since you can no longer have it done in a corporate-ran store.

I know rice is the go-to recommendation for water damaged phones and other electronics, and it works, to an extent. It will **passively** absorb moisture. Unfortunately, you don't want to passively absorb the moisture, you want to *actively* **remove** the moisture as quickly as possible. The longer the moisture is sitting on those circuit boards, the higher the risk of corrosion. And corrosion on electrical components can happen within just a few short hours. If the damage isn't severe, we'd take contact cleaner (essentially 92% or better rubbing alcohol, the higher the percentage, the quicker it will evaporate) and scrub the white or green powder (the corrosion that formed) with a toothbrush to remove it. If that corrosion crosses contacts, it can cause the electronics to act up, fail or short out. The liquid itself almost never is directly responsible for failed consumer electronics, it's the corrosion that takes place after the fact (or the liquid damaging the battery, a new battery fixes this issue obviously).

Every time I see someone recommend rice I kinda twinge a little inside because while it does dry a phone out slightly better than just sitting on a counter, it really doesn't do much to prevent the corrosion that's going to be taking place due to the length of time the liquid has had to fester inside the phone or whatever.

What you want to do is set the item in front of a fan with constant airflow. Take the device apart as much as you can without ruining it (remove the battery, etc) so that the insides can get as much airflow as possible. Even if it's not in direct contact with the air, the steady air blowing over the device will create a mini vacuum effect and pull air from inside. It's just a small amount but it's significantly better than just allowing the rice to passively absorb the evaporated moisture. True, rice can act as a desiccant, but a fan blowing over whatever is orders of magnitude faster.

I personally will take apart a piece of electronics completely, and put those items in front of a fan, and if you have the relevant knowledge, I highly recommend doing so as well. But if you don't, it's not that big of an issue. What you want to avoid at all costs, however, is **heat**. Do not put your phone inside an oven or hot blow dryer, heat can damage electronics just as bad as liquid, sometimes more so. Heat, extreme cold and liquid are bad for electronics &amp; cell phones. A fan (lots of airflow) is 99 out of 100 times better at removing moisture quickly than rice. I would say 100 out of 100 but I'm sure there's going to be some crazy situation or exception I haven't thought of that someone will come in and point out. I'd like to remind people that exceptions are just that, they don't invalidate the rule.","LPT: 15 years Repairing Electronics Here: With Liquid Damaged Electronics, DON'T Use Rice, Instead Use A Fan (explanation inside)"

LifeProTips,/r/LifeProTips/comments/u13044/lpt_caring_what_other_people_think_about_you_is/,"As a shy individual who spends a lot of my time beating myself up, the number one thing I hear from people in their 50's if I tell them this about myself is this: ""you remind me of a younger me"".

Point being, caring what others think is just sort of programmed into the minds of the average young person. But nobody really cares what others think about them by the time they reach their 50's. They just don't. They've lived enough life to see that it literally serves NO point. But they're the same person. We are so attached to it that we feel like validation from our peers is literally essential to survival. But it is not, in any way, whatsoever. So many of the older people I talk to just say they feel the exact same as they did when they were in their prime, just now they are in a 50+ year old body.

So, for the love of God, stop caring what others think of you, find something you love, put the horse blinders on, and just do the shit out of what makes you happy. There is absolutely no reason, whatsoever, that you need to care about how other people are perceiving you. It is only causing you unnecessary stress, at which nothing can be gained, even if you think you're doing everything right to keep others happy. Losing battle.

Maybe your life has become so unconsciously centered around winning other people's validation, that you don't even know what I'm talking about. You have a following, and that keeps you going. But you don't really know yourself that well. You're going to be addicted to tangible, destructive things when you get older: gambling, smoking, drinking, etc. because you can't get anybody to care about what you're doing anymore. Because you're old now, and nobody really cares about what you're doing or who you are, minus maybe your immediate family, if you have any (I know that was a harsh sentence but the right people will know what I'm trying to get at). You're one of the type of person that seriously needs help before it's too late. What you may think is socialization and healthy conversation with others about your life, achievements, and why you're definitely going to heaven is just your brain subconsciously trying to get a fix of self-validation off the person: ""I'm going to make sure this person knows how amazing I am and then breathe a sigh of relief "" like you just stuck a needle in your vein.

Point in summary: Just about everyone who gets past the age of 50 stops caring what others think about them because they finally see that it serves absolutely no purpose. So, if you're young, take their advice. Get the ball rolling early. It's easier said than done, but with a bit of courage, you can make your path by walking. We're all made of the same thing. So trying to keep everybody happy and constantly gaining reassurance that you're okay and everybody likes you is an addictive activity that serves zero purpose. The sooner you can legitimately stop caring what others think about you and just listen to yourself and trust yourself and your true endeavors, the sooner you have eliminated a toxic addiction from your body that will have bad long-term effects.

Edit: This was posted due to an epiphany I had recently. I should have specified that this post was meant to be directed to the people out there also like me who have done so much caring about what people think that we're sick and tired of beating ourselves up and having a gratuitous, illogical and harmful amount of self-doubt. I didn't say it was easy, but through some epiphanies, I have experienced true freedom from my form of this mental prison before, and from what it felt like, it's worth it to work towards feeling this way as much as possible as early as you can in life. Just remember to treat others how you'd like to be treated, basically.

Also, it sounds like a lot of you who disagree don't have the anxiety and self doubt like us, but still are trying to develop sensitivity to other's thoughts about you to become better people. And that's really nice to see.","LPT: Caring what other people think about you is just part of being young.

Our children grow up to an understanding that this is how life works. They are reinforced with the ideas that it must be ok. The very people they look up to do absolutely nothing but stand aside and watch. At a certain point, individuals become unknowingly numb to the process in which they are being controlled. It is easier to sit back and watch everything take place as it happens; Wind down a ominous path that was not self-chosen.  You have to stop and ask yourself, “But is it really…easier”? It’s all we know. We haven’t experienced any different so we cannot answer that question with any type of validity. So while we watch and wait, our minds think otherwise. 

We take account the reality of what is happening and we plan accordingly. We do what we can to stay on the path we believe is and should be an honest and fair for humanity. For every action there is a reaction. We didn’t set the curve but it can be flattened by using critical thinking, manipulation, and leverage. You turn the same game being used on you against your opponent without them being aware. It is then when succession begins to occur. Sometimes the enemy will even contribute to your success, not realizing it is to be used against them. And unlike others before us that have tried to manipulate our circumstances, we practice in a way where there is never harm nor hurt. 

We often go go through our day to day routines waking up and following the same patterns. These patterns have been embedded into our thinking. We complete the same mundane tasks only to achieve the same results. There must be moments of clarity to break this consistent pattern and question what exactly is our goal and how do we achieve them. We must have an awareness that although we stay on course to do what we have been taught is needed to achieve goals, there are several variables set in place form outside sources to keep our goals from being achieved. There are so many hidden underlying algorithms set in place to of set our productivity without us even being aware. 
There is fine print in life that has been constructed not only to confuse the ones that take the time to analyze it, but usually discourage many from continuing to proceed.

I absolutely struggle to keep up with my laundry (thanks to my adhd) so I often forget my clothes in the dryer and they get wrinkled. 


With no time to bust out the iron, I put the shirt on and crank my hairdryer up to its highest settings. I then hit the wrinkliest parts of the shirt and the end result looks decent. Takes no longer than 5 minutes and its a nice feeling on cold days. 


I am a college student, so there isn't a pressure for me to dress up with nice fabrics that this tip wouldnt work on, but im sure a sprinse of wrinkle-release spray plus the hairdryer would do the trick well for these clothes. 




###Additional

**Tips for people who struggle with laundry in general:**


- **Tubs.** Folding laundry is the bane of excutive function so just throw your clean clothes in tubs. I separate mine by shirts and pants. I put socks and underwear in my dresser drawers though. Visual need = tubs. No visual need =  drawers. I dump my tub out on my bed when looking for a specific item and swoosh everything back in the tub once done.


- **Luandry mesh bags** After you are done wearing your socks and underwear for the day, *keep then away from large item clothes like shirts and pants*. Make a separate pile in a corner of your room to throw them at, and then when you need to wash laundry... just scoop up the pile into the mesh bags and now you won't have to search for them in the clean big item clothes. Just dump the bag into its assigned drawer. I have 2. One for socks. One for underwear. 


- **Lint trap** Put a plastic grocery bag on a hook or something by the dryer to have a visual que to remember to check the vent for lint. Plus you can save up the lint for fires and stuff. You can think of it as resource gathering to gamify the chore.


(Beware of the dreaded color bleed of clothes though... haven't quite mastered that problem yet..)

Here is a list of items that will significantly help you out in a time of need:

**No mechanical knowledge needed. At worst you'll have to watch a 2 min YouTube video**

**Tire plug kit** (7 whole bucks, and arguably THE most important item)

**12v Tire inflator** ($25ish off Amazon. Plugs into your cigarette lighter. I have a Raptor and it's inflated my big ass truck tires from fully flat to 40 psi.)

**Portable Jump Starter** (Battery dead and you're all alone in a shady parking lot? Boom. Best $50 you'll ever spend.)

**Can of Fix A Flat** (only use this if you can't plug the tire with the kit above. $6 and itll get you to the shop.)

**Radiator Stop Leak** ($3. Car overheating? Pull over. WAIT FOR IT TO COOL DOWN. Open radiator cap, follow instructions.)

**Jumper Cables** ($10. Backup for when you inevitably forget to charge your jumper that's sat in your car for a year now.)

**Fuse Kit** ($3. Another extremely important thing to have. Learn your cars fuse box location. Literally shine a light and see which ones black. Replace that one.)

**Tire Change Kit** (Fucking. Free. Fifty. Free. Your car *should* come with one. Take 5 minutes to learn how to assemble it and lower your spare. You'll thank me later when you're not fumbling around on the side of the highway as 18 wheelers barrel past.)

*A small tool kit is also an absolute must, but I wanted to create a list that anyone can use without any mechanical knowledge.*

So I'm actually at $104 if you buy everything. I apologize for lying, forgive me. However, if you forgo the jump starter, you're in it for 50 bucks, but I highly suggest getting it. **The most** common breakdowns on vehicles are flat tires, leaks, blown fuses, or just plain old dead batteries.

I'll explain my self.

If what brings people towards you is anything other than your good attitude you can be in most cases sure that in the best case scenario they are there just because of what you can do for them / get some advantage of being around you.

Let's say you are the smartest student in your class and people know about this, one day there is a group project and people come to team up with you, ask your self why would they do it other than to benefit from your presence in their group they want you because of your skills and therefore they will have expectations on you.

It's not that bad I know, but picture a different case.

One where you don't stand out as much because of your grades, skills or whatever, you name it. 

But because of your good attitude, because you are that one person that hasn't screamed at anyone ever but instead solved problems talking, that one person that doesn't go oround judging others or trying to force their way onto them but the one who listen, trys to learn and cooperates adding their share to go through things as smoothly as posible, the one that instead of bringing a conflict out of a problem brings a solution.

Well then in this case you'll know that if people come after you it's most likely because of you as a person and not for you as a walking skill, because you have or are part of  this or that thing they can take advantage of etc 

They come to you because they feel like there's gonna be a good environment around you.

And if you think about it this may likely atract stable people, good team work partners, chill people who want to do things well etc

Notice that I'm not saying that working your ass and being the brightest one of you class or at your work place etc is a bad thing. 

I'm  just saying that if that is what people think about  when they think of you it might atract people driven by interest.

Most Walmarts sell needles and they don’t require a prescription. The only issue is a lot of places won’t sell without a reason to use them.

LifeProTips,/r/LifeProTips/comments/tzx39x/lpt_if_someone_suddenly_faints_or_goes/,"If someone suddenly faints or goes unconscious, try to remain calm.  

The first thing you should always do is lay them on their back, legs straight out and arms straight out to their sides.  Laying flat restores effective blood flow to the brain and could make them ""come to"" within milliseconds.  Be sure to hold their head as you lay them down - they will be limp.  

I.e. someone goes unconscious and slouches down with their back against the wall.  They will start jerking due to lack of blood flow to the brain and their nervous system will start firing rapidly and erratically - this will result in cardiac arrest.  This can easily be confused as a seizure.  Remain calm, and carefully lay them on their back as mentioned above.  Not doing this could result in death or permanent brain damage.  

If they don't come to within 3-5 seconds then you must call 911 and be prepared to start administering first and a CPR.  They will ask you to check pulse but the easier way to know if something is breathing is to calmly lower your head to the side of their chest to see if you can physically see if their chest is moving up and down.  Finding a pulse when your panicking can be very difficult  - especially when your adrenaline is pumping.  

This isn't a lesson for CPR.  I encourage everyone to take certified classes once per year.  Pay out of pocket or ask your employer if they would consider covering.  You may saved a loved ones life one day... or a stranger. 

Be kind and always be alert!

Note:  there are different steps for seizures or someone choking on food.  You must try to be aware of what happened.

Planning on drinking? Start drinking water before your night out. Pedialyte/Gatorade Zero or a similar electrolyte replenisher is even better, but plain water works well too. 


Once you’re drinking be sure to squeeze in a couple glasses of water. This part is easy to abandon once you’re inebriated, so make sure you stick to your plan. Once the night is over, drink another glass or 2 before bed - and a few sips more if you wake up to pee.

LifeProTips,/r/LifeProTips/comments/tzmjr2/lpt_safety_around_dogs/,"Disclaimer: These are tips I learned while working at a doggy daycare, but I am not a professional. Anyone following the below advice does so at their own risk.

1. Always carry a defensive spray (such as citronella) on your person, especially when around dogs. Learn how to use the spray properly, and utilize it to defend yourself or your dog when needed.
2. Do not make contact with an unknown dog without the owner’s permission. We cannot see by merely looking at a dog if it is aggressive or not. Teach children to never touch a dog without the owner’s consent.
3. If a dog locks its jaws on a person or another dog, do not stick your hands and fingers in/around its mouth. Call 911 immediately.
4. If you are going to attempt to stop a dog from attacking someone else or another dog, do the following: grab it by the hips, lift up so it is only on its front paws, and walk backwards. You are unbalancing the dog, taking away some of its leverage, and then separating it from what it is attacking. However, please note that it is possible the dog may attack you.
5. If a dog is attacking another dog, do not lift the victim dog into your arms and hold it there. The attacking dog may leap and jump on you, or attempt to attack you instead, while you hold the dog. Instead, pick up the victim dog and immediately get behind a barrier (such as a fence) or walk into another room and shut the door.

Use caution when around any dog, and always call emergency services as soon as possible if there is a dog attack. Injuries caused by dogs can be severe, even leading to death. Even known dogs can attack. Being prepared and knowing what to do in case of an altercation can save lives",LPT: Safety around dogs!

Sometimes that means too many people living in cramped spaces. Sometimes that means working on junker cars to 'flip' as able, meaning your yard is full of them. Maybe you had to move, and you are only supposed to have one dog, but you have two elderly pets who you wouldn't get rid of for the world over. Maybe you have to have a quasi-business out of the front room. Maybe you have to keep really weird hours.

Make life easier on yourself and try to be otherwise invisible. Don't have loud parties, loud fights, or let your dogs bark at night. In fact, try to be quiet during the day too. Remember, a neighbor who doesn't really notice you isn't going to notice the 'one odd thing' about you either.  Cut the grass and keep things tidy. Nothing to see is nothing to report. Clean up the kennel and keep the dogs inside as much as you can -- a neighbor who doesn't smell or hear your dog is very unlikely to care about your extra dog. Instead of starting your car and idling it (that's a noise that somehow goes straight through walls) get an oil pan heater and plug the car in so you can start the car and go before waking anyone if you have to keep early or late hours. If you have kids, take them to the park to be loud. (Added bonus that if you have to too many kids based on occupancy laws, it's a lot harder to count kids you can't see.) If you have a lot of people living at your home -- disguise the number of cars by any means available. Don't take your neighbor's 'spots' with any regularity if you live in a neighborhood where people park all along the sidewalk.

I always opted to get the cheap DIY version from the drugstore for $15.  The kind you boil on the stove at home for a few minutes then bite down on to save an impression.  Instead of the $600 one from the dentist.

Recently I decided to get my teeth straightened and visited an orthodontist.  Now I’m nearly done with my 2 year journey with Invisalign, and will be getting retainers soon.  They’re of the same material that both my aligners and the night guards are made of.  No difference at all.

But it got me thinking why my dentists never drew the parallels for me as a younger person.  “Hey, you grind your teeth.  You could also use some straightening.  If you get orthodontics done, both problems will go away.”

It seems so simple of a thing to recommend.  But I’ve always gotten the “either or” from them.  Either they would recommend a night guard.  Or alignment.  Never both in the same conversation.

Why? Because jobs can be taught and you can be trained in the skills needed to complete the work. Customer service skills, however, are not as easy to teach. When you display a poor attitude towards your customers, you may be shooting yourself in the foot without even realizing it.

1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, etc.  
The next number would be 13 + 21 = 34.

Here's the thing: 5 mi = 8 km. 8 mi = 13 km. 13 mi = 21 km, and so on.

You can also do this with multiples of these numbers (e.g. 5\*10 = 8\*10, 50 mi = 80 km). If you've got an odd number that doesn't fit in the sequence, you can also just round to the nearest Fibonacci number and compensate for this in the answer. E.g. 70 mi ≈ 80 mi. 80 mi = 130 km. Subtract a small value like 15 km to compensate for the rounding, and the end result is 115 km.

This works because the Fibonacci sequence increases following the golden ratio (1:1.618). The ratio between miles and km is 1:1.609, or very, very close to the golden ratio.

LifeProTips,/r/LifeProTips/comments/tyytz5/lpt_genuinely_caring_about_somebody_a_lot_does/,"This is something that I unfortunately didn't learn until well into adulthood - It may sound obvious when its spelled out, but when you're in the actual situation its not always so clear. Most of my life I thought if I really cared about somebody a lot, then they must care about me to some degree in return. It always felt like that connection was so strong it had to be mutual, even if the obvious signs showed otherwise. Despite certain people treating me like dirt and rarely reciprocating, I would do everything I could to make them happy. I would go out of my way to help them, say &amp; do nice things for them, encourage them, etc..with the assumption they'd eventually show their appreciation for me being in their lives. I'd think ""how could they not care about me when I make it so obvious how much I care about them? If I just keep trying they'll come around"". This was especially true for people who maybe showed signs they cared at some point in the past, but weren't anymore.

What I've learned over the years is that a lot of times that reciprocal connection is imagined. The amount you love somebody does not always affect how much they love you back. People can and will use you and your emotions. And just because somebody may have once cared about you in the past, doesn't mean they still do now or ever will again in the future...theres often nothing you can do to change their feelings through any good deeds or kind words.

I'm not talking about classic ""nice guy"" syndrome. Not the crush who friend-zoned you that you're desperately trying to win over by being nice when there should have never been any expectation of feelings to begin with...I'm talking about people who you genuinely feel a meaningful connection with. Whether that be friends, family, or romantic partners.

I wasted a lot of time on people expecting them to suddenly start reciprocating my feelings and actions. I'd be convinced I could win people over (or back over)...including bad friends and former relationships...if I was just nice enough to them and let my feelings be known. Looking back I should have cut my loses far sooner. I should have focused more on finding people who not only cared about me, but wanted to make me happy in return.

Its important not to assume somebody appreciates you just because you love them and do good things for them.You can waste a lot of time and energy focusing on people who will never really care no matter what you do.

**Edit** I should note, I don't mean to say you should only do good things for people if you expect something in return. There is nothing wrong with being nice to people just because it makes you happy (even if they don't appreciate it). But you can't expect them to some day change their minds. And you shouldn't let your desire to please people who don't care about you distract you from finding people who do.","LPT: Genuinely caring about somebody a lot, does not guarantee they care about you equally (or at all) in return. Some people will never care about you regardless of what you do or say. So don't assume somebody appreciates you just because you do nice things for them."

Children learn by example, and they pick up on so many nuances, minutiae, and unspoken truths.

1. Download subtitles that fit the movie in any language.
2. Create new empty .docx document using Word.
3. Open the .srt file and copy-paste it into the Word document.
4. Go to [deepl.com](https://deepl.com), and upload the document to be translated. This bypasses the 5000 character limit in the Web UI, and allows you to translate more text at once.
5. Download the translated document, and open it in Word.
6. Ctrl + A and copy the whole content of the Word document, and paste it into a new Notepad .txt file.
7. Save the .txt file as .srt
8. You now have a translated subtitle file.

I've already tried it several times, including for some video games that had text in a separate file, and it always worked well. The Deepl translator keeps the timing and formating of the .srt file, so the subtitles fit, and from what I have seen, the translation quality of Deepl is actually really good.","LPT: Need subtitles for a movie, but they are not available in your language?

A lot of times, you end up looking inefficient or incompetent if people believe that you should be able to do your work faster. 

I suspect I've encountered this a few times in my career to varying degrees, but the the example that prompted this is a woman I currently work with and with whom I am friendly. She has told me that in order to seem dedicated to her job and hardworking, she intentionally never takes lunch, even when her schedule would allow it, and she also makes a point to frequently tell people how busy her workload is. The problem is that many people she works with do the same job as her, or (like me) work closely with people that do, and they *know* what her workload is. Others have confided in me that they don't think she's very good at her job if it takes her so long after so many years in her field, and I've noticed that she's not being brought in on the more important projects anymore. 

Her ""busy-ness"" is producing the exact opposite result of what she intended, and it's going to have a long-term impact on her career. I think(?) her actions are a little more extreme than what most people would do to seem busy, but it is something to keep in mind, because I think many people do try to seem busy in order to look more hardworking and dedicated.

The woman on the line was the mother of a friend he had been with that night. She started the conversation by saying ""I've been trying to reach your parents for about a half hour. This will be difficult to hear but your brother was staying at a cabin with the boys last night and he had a psychotic episode of sorts. He hit one of his friends a few times, he was screaming and crying, and there's some severe property damage as well.""

Nowhere in that opener did I know for sure that he was safe. My heart just fucking took off and I was trying to stay calm but I had to ask ""is he okay?"" Like three or four times before she told me ""it was really serious, but the police are there now and he's safely restrained."" There was a good 30 seconds where I was trying to figure out how to cope with my brother being dead or severely injured when neither of those things were even the case to begin with.

I can elaborate on the situation in the comments if asked, but the point of this LPT is that if she had said ""your brother and everyone else is safe and relatively unharmed, but you need to know that something happened,"" I would have been calmer and less panicked in my responses (and panicked responses aren't generally as productive) and she could have spared me a lot of uncertainty and fear, which were incredibly intense, regardless of how briefly I experienced them.

LifeProTips,/r/LifeProTips/comments/tyavat/lpt_how_to_stop_procrastinating/,"If you procrastinate much as I do, you probably are familiar with the crippling feelings of stress and anxiety that go along with it.  I recently had a revelation about myself, these feelings, and why I procrastinate:

1). I know that I am very capable when I actually apply myself.  I’ve completed many projects in the past, and in fact, if I add up the hours I’ve spent *actually working* on those projects, I know I could have completed most of them well ahead of schedule.  Truly, the greatest obstacle I've faced on any project has been my own lack of time management.  Therefore, the anxiety I feel when thinking about a project doesn't come from the fear that I’m not *capable*; it comes from the fear that *I will fuck myself over by continuing to procrastinate*.  

2). When I am procrastinating, I don’t even think about the task I’m avoiding, and thereby I avoid all the negative emotions that go along with it.  It’s only when I finally sit down to work on a project that I have to think about it, and only then do I feel the weight of all that stress, worry, and shame. Because I only experience task-related anxiety when I am actively working on a project, *I have literally been conditioning myself to avoid working on my projects*.  Fucking Psych 101.

Taking these two things together, I have reached the conclusion that ultimately, *I procrastinate to avoid worrying about the fact that I procrastinate.*  What the fuck, brain?!?!

Does that sound like you too? Good, because I don't want to be the only asshole dealing with this bullshit.

So, what can we all do about this conundrum?  I'm just starting to work this out, but I think it starts with retraining your brain.  

When you sit down to work and you have to come to grips with all the work ahead, all the time you’ve wasted, that looming deadline, and you feel the panic starts to rise up...  Tell yourself, “Stop it.  Calm the fuck down.  *Now* is not the time when I should be worrying.  *Now* is the time when I should be fucking high-fiving myself. This shit that I’m doing right now is *how I am going to get this motherfucker done.*  And even though I know that what I’m about to do is just a tiny fraction of the project, I understand that by simply continuing on *just like this* and getting a little bit done at a time, I *will* achieve my goal.  With time to fucking *spare*. That's how it has always worked, and that's how it shall continue to work”  

You have to give yourself a pat on the back when you sit down to work instead of letting yourself choke on the stress.  Let your anxiety go because you know that you are actively, in that very moment, overcoming its source.  Feel the sense of accomplishment that you are entitled to for simply sitting down and planning your next steps. Realize that *this* is what completing a project actually feels like--just staying on task for a few minutes or an hour at a time. Make it a ritual, and schedule times throughout the day to ""get started again"".

Don’t let the fear of fear itself fool you into thinking you can’t get the job done.  

*Bonus tip:* You are going to need outside help at some point.  If you’re like me, you might let that stall your progress.  Maybe it’s a bit of social anxiety or maybe it’s embarrassment, but I always feel an initial aversion to asking someone else for assistance or information.  It’s bullshit.  No big project gets completed without outside help, whether that’s from a product support helpdesk, a coworker, a boss, or even a client.  Don’t let “not wanting to bother someone else” become your excuse.  Don’t deceive yourself into thinking it’s better for you to waste hours trying to figure something out on your own when a single phone call or email could do the job.  Just pick up the phone and keep the ball rolling.

Okay, now back to the project I’ve been avoiding...",LPT: How to Stop Procrastinating

Take a look at your bank account history and add up all the money you spend on food each month. Factor in your grocery expenses, fast food, coffee, snacks from the gas station, etc. Find the average and use that as a point of comparison for how much you spend while meal planning. This part isn't mandatory but I find it really neat to compare. Commit to 1 month of meal planning. Your comparison results will be skewed if you go off track.

**Meal planning**

1. First you need to think about how all the parts of you life, habits, and preferences should factor into your plan. How many people do you need to feed? How many nights do you want to cook? How long will you realistically eat leftovers for? Do you have an obligation one evening that could affect your plan? It's really important to think about all of these things and seriously consider your family's habits. For example, I won't eat leftovers twice. If I plan for that, I always end up going off track because 3 day old food is just not appealing to me. Also, I don't feel like cooking a big meal every night, so I build in an ""easy"" meal that I can make with my toddler that doesn't take a lot of time (think Grilled cheese and tomato soup). I also enjoy spending Sundays preparing a big meal, so I know that will influence which recipes I choose for the week.
2. Choose your recipes. It's important to read the instructions and ingredients before adding them to your list. There is nothing more frustrating than getting home ready to make your meal, and realizing it should have been marinated overnight. Also, if you see an ingredient you are not familiar with, check google for substitutes. That way if you get to the store and they don't carry it, you already have an alternative in mind. This happens often with health foods which might only be carried at specialty stores. If you're trying to save money, consider which ingredients (such as meat) will be more costly. **Bonus:** If you can find recipes that use the same ingredients, this will save you money.
3. Figure out which recipes will be made which night. I personally plan my healthier meals at the beginning of the week because I'm more motivated. By Friday, I might want some comfort food to take a load off the stress of the week. There is some flexibility to switch around meals by night, but I like to space out my meals so that I'm not eating similar things two nights in a row. If you plan to eat out, be honest with yourself and add it in your plan/budget. Don't plan 7 nights of cooking if you can't stick to it. If you plan a meal and eat out instead, you're wasting money and food. I personally plan 4 nights of real meals, 1 easy night, 1 ""fend for yourself night"" and 1 night of eating out.
4. Plan your lunch. Some people meal-prep lunches at night, but I find that takes way too long. I also don't want to meal prep 5 lunches on Sunday that I am sick of by Wednesday. I always make enough dinner to have left overs for both my husband and I for lunch and plan one free day to buy lunch. I would recommend this to anyone on a budget.
5. Plan your breakfast. The costs of coffee and breakfast sandwiches really add up. A quick, healthy breakfast is not hard to plan. I normally do oatmeal, fruit, eggs or english muffins. I pick one of those things and eat them all week. I will switch it up the following week. Each of these are good for a ""grab n go"" breakfast.

**Make your grocery list**

1. Throughout the week, keep a sticky note on your fridge. Every time you run out of something, write it on the list.
2. Make a list of all the ingredients from each recipe.
3. Take inventory. Anything on your list that's already in your pantry you can cross off. If you notice your low on a staple, add it to your list. Don't forget to consider non-food essentials (toilet paper, cleaning supplies, toiletries, etc)
4. Add all items from your collected list from the past week.
5. Share your list with family/roommates. They can tell if you if there is something you are forgetting or if they have a request.
6. Now re-organize your list by department. This is important. It will help you move through the grocery store more efficiently without having to go back for something you missed. I separate mine by: Dry, Frozen, non-food, dairy, bakery, meat, and produce.

**Get to the store**

1. Don't forget to grab your coupons!
2. At the store, stay focused! If it's not on your list, don't buy it. Period. Impulse shopping is no good.
3. Start with the inner isles. Canned goods, non-food, etc. those are heavier and nothing is worse than having cans on top of tomatoes.
4. Finish up with bakery, meat and produce. If you are planning healthy meals, this should be the bulk of your cart. Produce is cheap relatively cheap and if you fill your cart with it, you will save money!
5. Double check that you've crossed everything off your list before you leave!

**TIP:** Don't forget to buy on sale, but only if it's a smart move. *DON'T* ""buy one get one half off"" on perishable items that you won't eat within the week. *DO* take up good deals on your essentials (rice, frozen vegetables, oils, condiments). Make sure to compare sales. Sometimes the store brand price is already lower than the name brand sale.

There you have it! That's really my entire meal planning and shopping process. From there, all you have to do is start cooking. It takes practice to get it down, but when you've got it figured out, it starts to get easy.

**Here are some additional tips I would recommend:**

1. Type your meal plan with links to recipes and save them. When you don't feel like meal planning, you can resort to the archives.
2. If you don't have a food processor, get one! It's cheap and saves you so much prep time.
3. Crock pot meals are amazing for those nights you want to get home and just relax. Only problem is you have to prepare them the night before or in the morning.
4. Sign up for emails from sites like MyFitnessPal or Cooking Light. It's a great place for inspiration.
5. Plan to have a night that you don't need a recipe for. Grilled chicken and frozen broccoli requires like... zero brainwork. After a long day, that's important.
6. Remember that cooking is an art! Once you have enough experience in the kitchen, you don't need to spend as much time finding recipes. I'm at the point where I use recipes for inspiration, but I change them depending on my preferences.
7. Remember to bring your lunch! What's the point in all this if you end up buying lunch everyday anyway?! Seriously, set an alarm on your phone if you have to. But DONT FORGET YOUR LUNCH.
8. Plan desserts. I have a weakness for cookies. I actually might be addicted. If I plan in a night of cookie baking, it helps me from running to McDonald's at 9pm.
9. Remember to stay stocked on your pantry staples. [This list](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/articles/basic-pantry-101.html) can help you determine what those are

It's actually better when people keep looking, make eye contact with you, and smile. But better still is just to not stare and let me get on with my day without being self conscious.

LifeProTips,/r/LifeProTips/comments/tyaamh/lpt_turning_your_life_around_you_can_do_it/," So I used to be someone that posted in suicide watch and I'm pretty sure I've been depressed for a very long time. I came very close to just ending it all, but I figured, I may as well try everything else first before ending it all and I can commit suicide a month or two from now if I don't feel any better.

At first I was sceptical but what did I have to lose? Here's a few changes I made:

Getting more sunlight, even if it's just walking around the block a couple of times a day

Taking vitamins, eating healthier  
Doing 10-30 mins of exercise a day  
Talking about my feelings  
Doing cold water swimming a couple of times a week (this is my newest hobby, I love it)

Writing down 5 things I'm grateful for/am looking forward to every morning.

Doing random acts of kindness, even posting this is making me feel better about myself, the thought that it might help just one person is very gratifying.

Working on making new friends IRL but that's proven easier said than done! But what I've come to realize is alot of these feelings are biological and a few small changes do make them go away. I forgot that I was suicidal to begin with.

I've landed a decentish new job (it seems less stressful than what I was doing before and is a stepping stone if nothing else) that I start in the next couple of weeks and I'm going to start learning software engineering, or maybe get a degree in accounting or HR, to escape customer service work altogether in the next year or two.

After reading some of the comments, I wanted to clarify a few things about my post: 1.) I don't think that you should buy two smart devices to replace a baby monitor, doesn't make fiscal sense. This was moreso for folks who have a few devices around the house (laptop(s), phone(s), tablet(s), etc.) 2.) I don't think one should rely on Skype/Hangouts necessarily for long periods of time monitoring their baby. 3.) I don't think you should do this (or maybe go on the internet more generally) if you're not familiar with securing your network. I took that as a given.

The reason I thought this may be useful, is that we have no bathroom on our first floor, and that's where the living room is. When we're down there, which is most of the daytime hours, and the baby goes to sleep, and we need to run to the bathroom, or want to do laundry or something like that, it prevents us from running the steps a bunch of times to check on the baby.

Every time I walk out the front door of work/home, I check to make sure I've got the basic 4 I've listed above.

I forgot something, big surprise right? If you're leaving the house and you get the vague thought ""I'm forgetting something"" but can't remember what it is, just stand there for a second and figure it out. It'll usually come to me. Noticing that thought has saved me a bunch of times. Usually this happens when I've got something out of the ordinary that I've got to bring with me. Like I was in the shower thinking about my day and I was like ""I've got to get a haircut, make sure to grab a check off the desk"" and then I get wrapped up in getting all my shit together and feeding a baby and trying to iron a shirt and I barely make it out the door and I've mostly forgot about the check.

I have gotten better over the years - for example, I can have serious conversations about my struggles with a mentally ill family member with friends or SOs without crying, which used to be impossible. And crying when I'm downright sad is more understandable (and socially acceptable). But, as soon as I become frustrated or angry, like in an argument or confrontation with someone, it's as if these feelings manifest in tears rather than an ability to clearly and rationally articulate what it is I'm trying to say. And this is what I want to change.

I've noticed this lately in some tough conversations with my SO. I want to be able to just explain how I feel without getting emotional, but it's really difficult for me. Being vulnerable in that moment, the reality that what I have to say might be hard for them to hear, and my own feelings of hurt contribute to the emotional-ness, I think. But, what I'd rather do is learn to better articulate these feelings calmly, without crying or having my voice falter, so that they are better received.

My new job (as of 2 months ago) is business development, definitely more of a sales role, and my boss, plus most of the team, are based in Germany. (It's a US company, and I'm based in the US.). Better salary than before, and the company has a good reputation.

When I took the job, travel was not mentioned at all. It wasn't in the job ad (which just read ""remote""), nor in the contract I signed. The recruiter did not anticipate travel as being part of the job. But three weeks in, my boss told me that once covid restrictions lift a little, I will be expected to go to conferences, along with other travel (like internal sales events).  

I've conveyed to her that this comes as a surprise, and travel was not desired and will pose a problem. (I have been specifically looking for a travel free job, so this is a huge letdown.) She has tried to make light of it, and keeps saying whenever I bring it up (twice now) that we can talk separately about it. Then today she has told me she wants me to travel to the main US office for a sales training.  

This, combined with the job itself not feeling like a great fit, makes me think I should start applying for jobs again, which is not what I wanted after just a couple months. I'm 45 and this stuff is exhausting. But I also know that the US job market is healthy right now.

LifeProTips,/r/LifeProTips/comments/txsmyw/lpt_my_personal_strategy_for_panic_attacks_an/,"36m, I started experiencing panic attacks about 2 years ago. I am prescribed Xanax, I take it infrequently. I only use .25 if panicy, and .5 mg if having a big one. But I’ve found a cure that works for me and it’s fantastic. 

I have 3 types of panic attacks

Mental - Typically brought on by general anxiety or overthinking. 
Psychosomatic/physical - I feel like I’m having a heart attack or stroke. This is my main type of panic attack.
Hangover - I drink about once a week, and I do need to stop because my hangovers give me horrible anxiety. But drinking is fun and I’ve always been a joyful, pleasant drunk so it’s hard. I digress. 

Here’s my cure:

Step 1 - Drink 1/4 gallon of water as quickly as I can, typically 10 minutes or so.
Step 2 - Quiet room, some type of background noise, my computer hum actually calms me, sometimes music. If in public, take a walk to find a bench to go people-watching. Thinking about other people and imagining what could be going  on in their lives always gives me perspective. 
Step 3 - Here’s the magic trick - Pull out your phone and start texting (or calling) the people you love and tell them you love them.

Not just your dad or your kids; old friends, colleagues, anyone that have made an impact on you. People you always think to yourself “I gotta call her, it’s been so long”, people who are important to you. 

Compliment them. 
Ask them how their day is going. 
Tell them you’re sorry you don’t keep in as close of contact as you wish you would. 
Tell them something funny they said to you that one time that always stuck with you. 
Tell them about a time they showed you who they are and how much it meant to you. 
Tell them how you’ve been inspired to be a better person because of them.

It works.

Something about showing appreciation for others, showing gratitude, showing love and affection and even admitting fault to someone you love - all of these things raise your overall vibration.

I am hardly spiritual at all, I’m more of a logic/science-based person, so “spirituality and energy” typically never meant much to me when I was younger, however, there is something chemically different about your “energy” when you’re showing appreciation. It’s enough to make this stalwart, pragmatic skeptic believe in energy and vibration. 

Try it. It’s saved me tons of times. I hope it helps you, and by the way, I was having a really bad panic attack when I started writing this. It’s gone now.

And finally - I appreciate you :)

TLDR: If you are having a panic attack, call or text the people you love and tell them why they are so important to you.

Remember, that almost exclusively you only hear the success stories. Even when they emphasise the struggle they went through to gain the victory, it's still a success story. Those who struggle and fail are easily forgotten. 

Getting started usually requires money, with no guarantee you'll get it back. It's a whole different game if you can spend that money without risking your life and/or if you have somewhere to fall back if you fail. Almost always passion and hard work are not enough. In very rare occasions your business takes off immediately, in all other cases it doesn't. It may take all your time for years just to make ends meet. It might never really take off, but eventually pay your bills. It might slowly become successful. Or it might fail. Even when failure seems inevitable, it might be hard to let it go. 

If you make it, working self employed you're on your own. There's no steady paycheck and your income needs to cover also insurance and retirement benefits. Even on your days off, when you're sick or on a vacation you might need to get something done. It's hard to find someone to fill in. In many cases, you're literally on your own. 

You need to know your rights and responsibilities. Usually nobody reminds you of your rights, but if you fail your responsibilities, there will be consequences. 

There's costs everywhere. Things like banking might cost more to a business than it cost to a private person. You might want to get a little better insurance, and you need to make sure it's tailored to benefit you instead of just rip you off. You might need to pay to somebody to do your taxes.

1. Stick to \~3 - 4 topics; write them down on a 3"" x 5"" card.  DO NOT write EXACTLY what you intend to say.  Just write the topic down.  If you write the whole thing out and recite it, you'll sound stilted, robotic, or messy.  With just the topic you will sound conversational and natural.  Instead of writing *""I met Bob on the beach in Mexico 6 years ago when I saved him from getting mauled by a pack of feral chihuahuas""* just put *""How I met B.""*  It's also easier to read at a glance so you can do #5.  
2. If a topic has facts and figures that need to be kept straight, add those to the card.  I.e., *""6 parakeets, 7 puppies, 3 pounds of powdered sugar.""*
3. If you got a time limit, rehearse until you can stay inside it.  Try to keep from saying ""um"" and ""ah"" when you speak.  It's an easier fix than you might imagine and even if you cut them by only half it makes a difference.  
4. If you want to tell a joke, make sure it's absolutely funny and appropriate.  Tell it to a test audience and rehearse it more than anything else.  Even if you suck at telling jokes, a great one is still a gift.  If you can't find a good one or say it well enough, skip it.  A short speech without a joke is better than a long speech with a bad joke.  
5. Look at the audience in the eyes, shifting your gaze to each member as you speak.  If it makes you nervous, try gazing at their foreheads.  Most won't know the difference.  
6. If you have stage fright understand that the nervousness and sensations are you have are your ""fight or flight"" response kicking in.   It's literally your body amping up to either fight like hell or run like hell.   It's power.  Breath deeply and interpret the sensation as what will keep you focused and strong.  If nothing else remember nobody wants to chase or fight you.

LifeProTips,/r/LifeProTips/comments/tx4nmo/lpt_if_you_care_about_the_environment_and_want_to/,"Over the last few years it has become clear that our recycling companies are just grabbing the lucrative materials (metal and plastic)  out of recycling while everything else is being sent overseas where they then go through it one more time in hopes American processors missed something and then dump the rest in the ocean by way of their rivers. I only became aware of this once China refused to take our recycling a few years ago and it piled up on our side so I looked into why we even had that arrangement. 

Nobody stopped to ask how those straws were even getting to the ocean to begin with. That's how. The straws aren't a problem, our broken/corrupt/greedy recycling system is. When asked why they didn't just stop accepting plastics when they stopped recycling them, they said it would be too hard to get us to start recycling again if they ever started using them again. That's insane logic when they know where it ends up. 

So, starting today, either find out exactly where your recycling is going or stop recycling anything but caustic materials like batteries. That way our plastic goes to a managed landfill that is managed far better than the ocean or even the landfills we were scared about in the 80s. And heck, get enough metals in landfills and future companies will mine them instead of new sites. Every time that land gets turned over, more things successfully biodegrade. 

Now, maybe you'll find out your regional landfill isn't managed properly (might still be better than the ocean)  or maybe your recycling program actually does recycle plastic. Use that information to the best of your ability. And hey, be angry at your leaders for indoctrination telling us we were doing good all those years when we were just giving them a cheap product to sell. At the very least, learn exactly what things they want and don't just mindlessly throw all plastic items in when they don't recycle stuff like grocery bags or straws or kuerig cups.","LPT If you care about the environment and want to help, stop recycling."

Eventually the asshole will slip up and do something asshole-ish, but because they have been pretending to be nice this whole time, it’s easy for everyone to say “Oh that doesn’t sound like them, they’re usually so nice! How can they be an asshole?” This then allows the asshole to continue to pretend to be nice until the next opportunity to be an asshole presents itself, and the cycle continues until they do something so asshole-ish the evidence cannot be refuted.

LifeProTips,/r/LifeProTips/comments/twzd5d/lpt_learn_how_to_put_a_leash_on_that_little_voice/,"

Ok so whats the most dangerous, most beautiful thing that humans posess? The mind. I believe its the main thing holding people back from enjoying their lives to the fullest. That little voice in our heads and our toxic thinking habits. Dont worry tho i got you.

Ok so first let me explain how personality works. As far as we know , we’re all put in random bodies, to random families, in random cities, in random circumstances. From the moment each of us are born, from every new conversation, to everyone new person you meet and every new experience you go through TO THE TINIEST DETAIL, all of these components and WAYY more, are what start molding our thinking and behaviorial habits, and these habits make up our personality. (Which literally changes every day) basically the little voice in your head is the way he/she is because of every TINY detail thats happened in your life. We are all products of our circumstances. 

Now i hope you kind of understand why people think and act the way they do now. But just knowing that wont free you from the shackles of overthinking and irrelevant stress. Now lets understand why that little voice in our head is the biggest demon ever.

Ok so whoever’s reading this, you… i bet you’ve felt like the main character in life your whole life, literally EVERYONE feels like that. None of us know what it’s like to live any other life except our own. So whatever you’ve been raised or “conditioned” to believe is right , is whats going to be right to you. And thats how it is for literally every human being. Now why is this bad you may ask. Well im pretty sure you believe that they are people that do “wrong” things and you have your own opinion of a “bad”person.. ok well now imagine that this “bad” person has a kid, for example lets say a slaveowner has a kid, and he raises him with the same beliefs under the same religion, the kid will most likely grow up to believe the same things. And this might not sit well with a few of you but he wouldn’t be wrong, well to you maybe , but that’s literally my point, every single person’s opinion is right to them. 

Ok now finally , how to use all this knowledge to your advantage. The biggest tip for keeping that little voice in your head on a leash, is learn the difference between facts and opinions RIGHT NOW, im 17 and i hate seeing adults that think the two are the same. Let me put it like this, if EVERY single person in the world HAS to agree on it without lying , (like 1+1) then it is a FACT.. but if you can ask EVERY single person in the world and they can give different answers,( like if your pretty or handsome) then it is an OPINION. So anytime that little voice in your head is talking to you OR WHEN ANYBODY TELLS YOU ANYTHING, analyze if what its saying is a fact or opinion. And if its an opinion, remember everyone has a different perspective. Its helpful to listen to as many different ones as you can so you can pick through them yourself and apply what you think fits best in your life, i promise you can learn ALOT from EVERYONE. 

I mean honestly, nobody can answer what reason humans were put on earth, but whats one feeling that EVERYONE (id hope) wants and enjoys feeling? Being Happy. Soo, im not a priests or anything but id say that would be our purpose, to be happy.

Tips to living a happy life-
1)Learn the difference between facts and opinions in your thoughts 
2) Learn how to tell if what other people are saying to you are facts or opinions and if their opinions are opposite of yours, understand that none of you are right or wrong, You dont always have to waste your energy arguing your opinions, being right is overrated.
3)Figure out what genuinely makes you happy,( keep moving around and trying new things until you find it , i dont want to hear “but ill never” THATS AN OPINION.. life is limitless with endless possibilities 
4) Dont try to plan your future too much(anxiety) , or reminisce on your past too much(depression) 
5) And last but MOST IMPORTANTLY … BE IN THE PRESENT MOMENT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE , ITS ALL WE EVER HAVE, GET OUT OF YOUR HEAD‼️",LPT: LEARN HOW TO PUT A LEASH ON THAT LITTLE VOICE INSIDE YOUR HEAD

Whether it's interpersonal customer service or a technical service that's being provided, several things will happen when you look for reasons to compliment workers in any size business:


1, You will find yourself seeking out the positive attributes in everyone and you will find them more and more. You will notice and appreciate small interactions.


2, You will help good workers.

3, This feedback should make it back to the frontline workers which encourages continued positive behaviour. How often does a corporate tip line or manager get called to the front only for a complaint? It doesn't always have to be like that. Middle-management can look good too by passing customer compliments up their chain. It can foster a better relationship between the tiers of workers.

Never hesitate to speak up and go for something you want or oppose something that bothers you. People are too involved in their lives and problems to pay too much attention to you and judge you.

2. Communicate: Always be clear in what you want and honest about your intentions and thoughts. Most problems can be traced back to a small miscommunication. It's hard to be forthright about what you want especially during a disagreement or with a new person, but it's always better and saves you a lot of headache in the future. At least, you won't have to worry about something coming to bite your ass in the future.

3. Compliment: Never hesitate to compliment someone if you find something good about them. Chances are, it'll make their day.

4. Never feel bad about saying no: If you don't like something, say no. Never feel bad about saying no a 100 times. I've seen instances where people say no, but they eventually relent and settle after a while, because they feel bad. You don't have to. You owe no one anything, not even people who love you the most.

5. Be independent: After all is said and done, you'll face your biggest battles alone. Better to be prepared to face them yourself, than relying on someone else to help you with it. Yes, people will help, but you can't expect them to always. Also, It's okay to be alone. A relationship isn't all be and end be. Only if you're happy and self sufficient will you be able to form a healthy relationship. You're happy by yourself, your SO is happy by themselves and you both make each other happier.

6. Don't expect things from people: As I said before, you owe no one anything. But the same is true for other people too. You can move mountains for someone, but if they don't feel like doing anything for you, that's that. It's on you to choose to put effort into someone who'd reciprocate it. I mean, if you do something for someone you love, you should ideally do it to make them happy, not expecting something back. That makes it a business deal, pretty much. You do you, they'll do what they want and you'll find it will align up pretty well without you trying to.

7. Don't take life too seriously: Life is messy, life is weird. Shit happens. Take everything in its stride and do the best you can. You can't control everything, actually, you can't control anything but yourself. So it's pointless to worry about the what ifs and maybes.

Effectively, we are the middle-men who enable businesses to accept Credit Card (and Debit) payments. We might also be called a ""Payment Processor"" or ""Payment Gateway"".  

If you've ever stuck your credit card into a machine to pay for something at a store, that's our (or a competitor's) equipment, but we also handle eCommerce and mobile payments. 

When processing payments, a percentage of each amount is charged as a transaction fee to the business, anywhere from 1 to 3 percent, depending on the card. 

However, these rates are not set in stone, and are frequently raised or adjusted by the providers, often without the approval or knowledge of the business owner, besides a brief mention in the fine print on their statement.  

There is always some room for negotiation on these rates, though, and we set them as high as we feel is possible. There is always plenty of room to reduce those rates in order to retain individual customers. 

Every once in a while, especially after a rate increase, our customers call in with a 'competitive offer' from a different provider, and we will offer to reduce their rates, either to match the mentioned rate, or as much as is possible to hopefully keep you on board. 

We never really investigate whether the offers being mentioned are legitimate, and have pre-determined amounts we are permitted to reduce the rates by, in order to keep your business. 

So, if you feel you are overpaying, or see an increase in your processing costs, it can't hurt to give your provider a call. 

Even if you don't have a competitive offer, simply asking to review your rates will likely result in an offer to reduce them even by a small amount. 

It's best if you are aware of what your current rates are, and come up with a 'plausible' counter-offer you'd have received from a competitor -- if you ask to slash the rates by 50% right off the bat, it might raise suspicion, but a 15-20% reduction is achievable. 

For the smallest businesses, the effect of this change might not be that huge, on the order of 20-30$ per month, but for businesses with large volumes of sales, or large individual purchase amounts, the reduction in rates can really add up. And it's free!

This mostly applies to Independently-owned businesses, however, since most Franchised and Corporate locations are already receiving reduced rates due to the size of their sales volume, or membership in an association. 

I must say, though, that to have the best chances of success, you should be as polite as possible to the Call Center reps who handle your call. We are more likely to bend the rules even further for someone we feel isn't being overly combative about it.",LPT: Own a small business or know someone who does?

It’s a fairly common “just so” story among certain white collar workers, especially the older workers, that people who wake up early are more successful.

It’s also bullshit. [There was a study of undergraduate students](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-03171-4) showing the sleep regularity and consistency was a better predictor of performance than specific sleep onset times or wake times, or even duration of sleep.

So go ahead and lean into your ideal schedule to the extent you can. Wake up at 8, 9, or even 10. That means students should choose classes they know fit their schedule better, rather than trying to force themselves to be early risers. That means choose employers and career paths that value productivity rather than early morning visibility. 

And if you’re a supervisor or policymaker, set policies that recognize that your teams can be more productive if scheduling fits their strengths rather than trying to force them to be something they’re not.","LPT: Waking up early isn’t necessary for career success, and can be counterproductive for some.

LifeProTips,/r/LifeProTips/comments/tw7gur/lpt_18_things_i_wish_i_had_known_at_18/,"I am turning 28 soon, here are some things I've learned the hard way over the past ten years.

1. Family comes first. Always. Most of the people I was friends with at 18 are no longer part of my life. My family all still is. 
2. Stay out of one-sided friendships. Things don't have to be 1-for-1 in terms of money, but there needs to be give and take. I lost so much time and money always giving rides and buying meals for people who had nothing to offer me besides ""being fun to play games with"". 
3. Do spend time with the friends who aren't using you. Before you know it, most of them will either move away or get very busy with their own careers and families. Take every chance you get.
4. When asked for an opinion on what to do or where to eat, offer a real answer. Two people who are both ""good with whatever"" often settle for something that neither of them want.
5. Don't be so afraid of rejection. Ask the woman out, apply for the scholarship, try to land an invite to the party.
6. Drinking sugar should not be an everyday occurrence.  Frappucinos, soda, shakes, bubble tea, energy drinks, slushies, etc. are all bad news. I gave all of that stuff up a couple years ago and lost about 50 pounds from it! 
7. Don't be afraid to go alone. You will look back and fondly remember the time you spent at the movies or fair on your own. Might even make new friends there! Sitting around waiting for people to join you is a huge time suck.
8. Games with collectible components are a huge money pit. Don't buy them! Trading card games of any kind, D&amp;D, Warhammer.  You will NEVER have enough. There is always a new set to buy or ""improvements"" to make.  Some of my friends still haven't figured this out. They basically have a car payment but no car!
9. Never accept a credit card unless you know you can pay the whole limit off every month. Don't even give yourself the option to carry a balance.
10. Quality over quantity when it comes to alcohol. One $12 Old Fashioned at the bar is cheaper and more enjoyable than 5 Bud Lights at $3 each.
11. Weekends are for adventures. I've been so much happier since I stopped spending my weekends in front of the TV or at the mall and instead opted to find something interesting to do. Hikes, events, museums, get out and do something.
12. Learn to cook! Experiment and have fun with it! Saves money and can impress a date.
13. Don't do field work, it isn't worth it. Driving around the whole state and meeting lots of different people for work is exciting for the first six months. After that, you quickly realize that the mileage checks don't pay for the damage it does to your car. It also held back my earnings potential, higher-ups tend to give raises to people they see every day.
14. It's okay to not have a dream job. I have since been promoted out of being a road warrior. I have no interest in climbing the ladder any further. I now pursue my passions on my own time instead of mixing them with work. 
15. Do whatever needs to be done at work, whether it is ""in your job description"" or not. I only received my promotion because I would step up to do the dirty work. I was a Field Engineer and often helped in our warehouse if we were shorthanded.
16. Living in an HCOL area isn't worth it unless it lands you a job that pays accordingly. I took the opposite path of many people, moving from the Big City I grew up in, to a small town.  Being able to walk to fancy coffee shops is fun, but I never would have been able to buy a house or go on as many adventures if I had stayed. For a professional like a doctor or lawyer, the math will likely be different.
17. Travel is to be enjoyed, not compared. Post on social media if you like, but selfies at front gates aren't the purpose. Don't go just to ""check things off the list"", visit places you are interested in and enjoy them.
18. If you choose to gamble, see it as entertainment only.  Set a limit ahead of time, and if you spend that much money, call it a day.",LPT: 18 things I wish I had known at 18

Before the internet, companies used to advertise vacancies by putting up a sign in the window or an advertisement in the local. This resulted in the vacancy being advertised to anyone who read the paper or saw the sign. Roughly 99% of people who saw the sign probably lived in a 15 minute commute of the location. As a result, it’s safe to assume that anyone who applied for the vacancy was a local.

Since applications have moved online, it has allowed for more people to apply for jobs. Before only people from a local area like Long Beach would apply for a vacancy in Long Beach. Now people from Anaheim, Inglewood and Pico Rivera are applying for the same role. This has made it super competitive but it has also resulted in companies being scared that employees won’t last at the job because of long commutes.

Because of the over application of jobs in my neighbourhood, I’ve been applying to jobs across the city (nothing crazy far, all within 1 hour commutes). So far I’ve applied to 132 jobs and I’ve been to 26 interviews. 4 of the interviews have been at places on the other side of the city (all approx 1 hour commutes). The hiring managers at 3 of the 4 places mentioned that my address was a factor working against me. They mentioned that they’re worried about the commute and they don’t think I’ll stick. 2 of them said they would offer me the job only if I accepted a lower wage. The salary advertised for the first one was $42,562. They offered a reduced salary of $38,485. The second place initially offered $44,477, they then reduced it to $41,324.

Mortgage - $1100 (4 bd, 3 bath)

Health Insurance - $600 

Student loans - $0 (didn’t go to college)

Car - $0 (paid off car)

Car insurance - $100 

Cell phones - $110 (T-Mobile, 2 phones)

Neighbor mowing lawn 2x/month- $100 

Home security system - $60

Gym Membership - $30

Massage - $100

Leisure - $200 (alcohol, eating out, etc)

Savings: $500

Total: $4,000

Minimum salary required: $55,000

Hourly wage 40 hr/wk: $26.50/hr


Now before you roast me for only saving $500 when the total expenses are 4K, I’m only using 55K as an example. I actually save ~$2K a month. “Experts” say your budget is supposed to save like 30% of your income or some shit (which I do). You can do the math if you really want to know how much I actually make. 

Anyways, my point in showing you this list is that living on one income is not nearly as hard as people make it seem. You really only need 48K/yr after taxes for this to work…which is basically nothing. **This is the equivalent of two people working full-time at McDonald’s for $13.50/hr.** 

There’s even room to buy a brand new car if I just cut out the massage, my wife does her own hair, and I cut my own grass. That’s an extra $350 right there. Maybe cut back on the booze and eating out for another $100 for car insurance. 

Unless you live in an area with ridiculous COL expenses, or you have 3+ kids, this budget (or one similar to it) should be fairly easy to follow. If your area is too expensive, look for a better job or move. And if you have more kids than you can realistically care for, *then that’s on you.* But don’t complain about not making a livable wage, when you clearly can make enough money if you make different choices. 

This budget even follows the 3.5x rule for the mortgage, and I purposely factored in plenty of leisure expenses so nobody can call it “unrealistic.” I think these expenses are average, but if you disagree feel free to tell me what I missed. 

TL;DR stop paying $7 for coffee and invest in shitcoins instead. No but really, stop buying $1200 phones and brand new cars.",LPT: Stop living above your means and make a budget. Most of the people complaining about the economy are just bad with money.

*So just some important information for all of you guys, I hope those of you who are serious enough and want the truth, would actually spend some time reading science and eye biology.*

**Nearsightedness : Stage 1 - Pseudo myopia, Focusing muscle spasm (Ciliary muscle)**

You've been doing a lot of near work days, 50cm from your screen for hours a day, your focusing muscle locked up. You try to look at the distance and everything's blurry, so you go to the optometrist and you're fit with normally a -0.50 to -1.25 lens that lets you see clearly. Wearing the lens for distance causes no harm.

* When used for near however.....

**Stage 2 - Axial myopia (real myopia)**

You've been wearing your distance minus lenses for close up, and after a while your prescription goes up again.. Why is that? Wearing these glasses for near cause extreme stress that the focusing muscle can't possibly tolerate, **hence the eyeball physically elongates itself in order to relieve some stress - axial myopia/true myopia.** You go to the optometrist and now your prescription worsened a little bit. You keep reading with them, and the cycle repeats itself until you're old enough, usually around 25. This is why basically every kid getting his first full minus at 6 will end up with 5-9 diopters of myopia by the time he is 18.

\--I highly suggest you all watch Todd Becker myopia video, and Jake Steiner Endmyopia. In short, only wear as much correction as you need for a given distance, will be explained in the vid mentioned above.

***\*Myopia is not a disease nor an illness, it's just a negative refractive state of the normal eye and can be completely prevented and even reversed to some extent (by inducing slight myopic defocus, explained in the videos above) if you know a little bit of science .***

***-This post wasn't made to bash up optometrists/doctors. Most don't know about it and aren't even taught this at school. This is all pure science shown in many studies already in Google scholar (Pseudomyopia, Lens induced myopia, Hyperopic defocus).

Also a concussion is still a TBI. In 2015 when I had a TBI that should have killed me, I did not lose consciousness. That means you can be fine for a time with mild symptoms that can get worse. 

Which is why if you suffer a blow to the head always get it checked out. Even if you lack medical insurance still see a doctor because not being diagnosed with a concussion (if you have one that is) can cause long term issues because you didn't treat it properly.

If it was a bad enough blow to the head that you were dazed, get a MRI or CT scan. A head injury that doesn't look serious enough can still cause brain bleeds.

Lastly, if you had a blow to the head or a sibling does or you kid does and is in athletics, pull them until they recover. Second impact syndrome kills. Also not recovering is part of why people get CTE as well. It's better to miss the season than to be dead. 

Also for you student athletes, I know it's standard practice to take the IMPACT test every two years. If you have a concussion and are unable to pass it and suddenly you do, take caution. This happened to me and I was back in the water competing a month post TBI. When I talked to my nuerosurgeon about it, he nearly pissed his pants because according to my impact scores I shouldn't have improved that much to allow me to compete again.

Since then, I have been flying without luggage. Things for a week trip fit perfectly in a small backpack.

It's convenient to travel with hand luggage, especially when traveling between cities and countries by public transport. Dragging a suitcase back and forth from the apartment/hostel to the train station or bus stop is tiring, and a backpack behind your back becomes real salvation. And it also helps to save money, time and nerves. A flight without luggage is almost always cheaper, and after landing, you won't have to jostle at the luggage belt and worry about the safety of your stuff. Still, it's important to take high-quality and reliable carry-on t to avoid any unforeseen damages. From my experience, I know for sure that a good suitcase is one of the most important conditions for a successful vacation. That's why I spent enough time searching for a reliable company three years ago, and I found Monos Travel, where I got my carry-on bag that didn't let me down since then.

Most likely, a trip with one hand luggage won't suit those traveling for the first time who don't know their set of necessities and for parents with young children who need to carry many items and clothes. Well, for ten days without luggage, it's hard to go either. But for those ready to give up a big suitcase, I'd share five rules for packing a backpack for a journey up to ten days.

1) Check airline rules and weather forecasts.

2) Collect only necessary stuff.

3) Put on you the warmest and most voluminous clothes.

4) Lay all the chosen things out in plain sight to eliminate unimportant stuff.

5) Roll your clothes into tubes, fold them in packets, and then in your bag.

It’s important to know that this isn’t true. These register donations are important for many charities and you shouldn’t be put off from making the donation because you think the company is stealing some tax benefit from you. 

Some accounting basics: a debit increases asset or expenses accounts and reduces liability and revenue accounts. Credits do the opposite. Every journal entry must have credits and debits that equal out. This is double entry accounting.

Expenses that can be deducted flow through the income statement, which is a statement of revenues and expenses. The balance sheet is a picture in time of a company’s assets, liabilities, and owner’s equity.

When this sort of transaction occurs, the asset account that the money is being held in is is debited and the liability account is credited. The opposite happens when the money is paid out. This is a balance sheet transaction and never hits an expense account. 

If the donations were miscounted as a revenue ie debit the asset, credit the revenue account, when taken off the books, you would need to credit the asset account and debit the expense account. The expense would just directly offset the revenue that was collected resulting in a net-0 tax effect.

This is a general, simplification of how the accounting for such a transaction should work. Businesses can’t use your donation as a deduction.",LPT: Charitable contributions at the register

LifeProTips,/r/LifeProTips/comments/tv2kbx/lpt_journaling/,"# INTRODUCTION:

I recently read this book 'Do it Today' by Darius Foroux. One take away from the book was to journal. Allow me to explain. 

# WHAT TO DO:

In the evening, when you're packing up for the day, journal. Journaling is essentially the process of replaying your whole day in your mind and writing it down. In the long run, this helps you to analyse the following things:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Where am I wasting my time?
2. What are my true feeling about a particular person/situation? 
3. What are the things that I did that made me happy/productive?
4. Am I able to spend enough time with my loved ones?
5. Did I make a mistake somewhere? If so, how can I improve?

And many more...

&amp;#x200B;

Journalling is basically recording your performance for the day, and analysing how you can improve that performance. 

One analogy I use is that, how musicians record their performance, watch the clip again and again and find faults, they rectify their mistakes and repeat the process. Well, by the time they reach the final performance, they're as good as flawless. This is the whole idea of journaling.

# PERSONAL EXPERIENCE:

I have been journalling for the past one month daily, and I find that I am able to truly reflect. In my personal experience, here's how it has helped me:

In this one month, I have been able to:

1. Truly reflect on the behaviour of my University ""friends""
2. Truly reflect on the behaviour of a true friend and realised his importance in my life :)
3. Could reflect and understand my own wrong behaviour on a particular occasion
4. I've become overall more productive as constant journalling also builds constant awareness of time

# CONCLUSION:

Of course, what you do at the end of the day is your choice. I would highly recommend the book to ya'll nevertheless and I sincerely hope this post could help someone out :)

LifeProTips,/r/LifeProTips/comments/tuzyl2/lpt_better_pay_doesnt_mean_better_job_sometimes/,"With many people leaving jobs for new ones, or resigning to seek better pay I think this needs to be said better pay **DOES NOT** in any way mean better job or **better standard of living**.  There are a couple of things that go into this including Cost of living for the area that you move just cause you made 50k in Indiana and are now gonna get paid 80k in Cali it doesn't mean your take home pay is gonna go up in fact it probably will be less.  Another is work life balance many companies don't actually follow up on letting you take any of the PTO you have. yeah you have unlimited PTO, but you cant use it cause there is always another deliverable around the corner and you just need to finish that sprint.   


A few examples are major tech companies in silicone valley many of these companies offer amazing work packages with insane amounts of pay. These companies also suffer from severe burn out with most young workers lasting 1-2 years. I have had 8 friends in tech some having internships others working for a few years and none of them are still in it after 5 years. My friends worked at a wide variety of places including places like Intel, google, youtube, and HP none of them are still there cause its just to much stress and to much work. Note 3 of these people where on the best code-a-thon team in USA several years back so they where good at it.    


**My own example**  
I worked for a construction company for a year and a few months I was paid a Per Diem for having to move to a construction site on top of my salary. I worked 7 days a week and wasn't paid hourly this was by far and away my best paying job in 5 years of employment and I hated it.  By the time I was letgo I was burnt out, tired, suffering from depression, anxiety, and slight PTSD that I'm still dealing with today.  I would wake up multiple times a night grabbing for my phone thinking I had been called but it was just nightmares. Many times I would get home after 16 hour long days and fall asleep in my work clothes wake up the next day shower and leave for work again. Several times field engineers ended up crying from stress and were mocked for it behind their backs.  I had TDY cancelled on me two times, PTO 3 times, my thanksgiving privilege's revoked at the last second. My PTO that I reserved to take off on my bday to sit at home and just relax revoked that I had set out ahead by almost 6 months. (I don't use ptsd lightly I was getting called all hours of the day and night to come in when I hear that ring tone for my work phone I still get cold sweets.)  


After the job It took me 2 months to start applying for jobs again, during that time I slept, cried, and had suicidal thoughts. I hated myself. The other engineers where good people, but managers,  and superintendents treated us like shit.

        What are the key differences? Well an RPG gives you clear cut objectives and quests to meet in order to have a guaranteed positive affect on your in-game position (gear, exp, crafting). In real life you are not given a handbook that gives you step by step instructions on where to go and what to do, you’ve got to decide those things for yourself. 
      
        What can you do about this? Create “quests” or larger objectives in a planner or note of some sorts. Then research and outline every single step of the process, in order. You can use this as your own, IRL, “quest book”. 
      
        Start with the small stuff, and work your way up through the list of objectives, crossing them off as you go. I find that if I think too big, without clearly defining the process, it’s easy for me to get overwhelmed and confused. Just baby steps, and keep on going!!

I repurposed an idea from the ""Zettelkasten"" community of knowledge management to make those old policies more accessible and understandable: You do not know a thing unless you wrote about it, in your own words. Collecting information is not the same as understanding. This is known as the ""[collector's fallacy](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/collectors-fallacy/)"". 

So I started to scan all my old contracts, read the fine print (yes, that's utterly boring) and \*wrote a cover document\* for each one, indicating

* the aim of the contract (""this insurance pays if...""),
* where to find the physical copy of the contract; the paper version,
* how to contact the company behind it,
* how to manage the contract itself (generally just a link to some web portal of the insurer),
* when to re-visit or re-evaluate it,
* where to get information about competitors (""how to find out who is cheaper""),
* and the most relevant things that would need to trigger actions from me (""I need to notify them of every job change"").

Each contract goes into a folder (in my case in a personal document management tool, but it could just be in your file system on your computer). On the top level, there is only that ""character sheet"" of the contract. Subfolders hold the scans of all the official documents, of account statements and so on.

 Some Roses are easier to root than others and that’s why we use a rooting hormone. It will help stimulate the rose cutting to encourage root growth. There are different methods to storing your rose cuttings after the rooting hormone has been applied.  Make sure the rose plants are not in direct sunlight and the wound is sealed and kept moist. If the conditions are correct like temperature and light with the right amount of moisture you will begin to see some roots emerge as little white knobs at the end of the cutting. This will take place in just a few weeks.  Let the roots grow out at least an inch or two before planting into the soil. Again, do not plant your newly rooted rose cutting into direct sunlight. It will stress the roses out and they will die rapidly which will waste your time. Leave them in a shaded area with temperatures ideally between 70-80 degrees F.",LPT: if you have a rose flower and a potato you can regrow it

In fact, it's sort of a pattern we've all noticed with Person 1 to get people, guys and girls, very drunk at parties while she herself isn't that drunk, and take advantage of that vulnerability to pull them aside and try to make out with them. Now, while this person even without being drunk has grown to be someone I dislike, I can't blame my girlfriend for still speaking with her as we're all in a group of friends and it'd be really awkward to just ignore her, on top of the fact that she can be a pretty normal and enjoyable person to be around normally. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, despite knowing that we've been dating, it seems like Person 1 insists on spending as much alone time with my girlfriend as possible, and has tried multiple times to get her in the situations that I've mentioned before. It's to the point where I truly don't think my girlfriend is going to cheat on me or anything, but it's just blatant disrespect coming from Person 1 and, as old-fashioned as this sounds, if she were a guy I would've already handled things vastly differently, as I think almost anyone would've. 

&amp;#x200B;

But that's where the problem comes up: She's not a guy. I can't intimidate her the way I could a guy and I can't be controlling and tell my girlfriend never to hang out with her again. I don't know how to deal with this. I can't just go up and talk to her about it as she's not really my friend and she's shown before that she clearly understands the predicament this puts me in and doesn't care, but I also can't act like a tough guy to try and scare her off. I know I must sound like a caveman but I'm out of options. On the other hand, it feels pretty disrespectful coming from my girlfriend to still hang out with the person she basically cheated on me with.

But if you wanna approach someone, try learning about social cues which indicate they aren't interested when you decide to strike up a conversation. Plenty of resources from books or online, or even professionals might be able to help you to better understand what those social cues are.


What works for one person may not work for another, but that's just the randomness of human interaction.

Making sure they aren't busy with something,  making sure you aren't blocking their way, having an innocent conversation to gauge whether or not they even wanna talk to you before you escalate to anything ""flirty"", and giving your number instead of asking for theirs can help you in case you are worried about being seen as a creep.


And that's just a few of the things you can do.


There are many more and I encourage you to learn them.


Just cause one OP might say it's wrong doesn't mean it is.

Hell, plenty of examples even challenged OP's opinion that all flirting at the workplace or at the gym is bad.

Funny, when you try to add black and white observations in an environment where things might be random and inconsistent, they end up not matching.


That's called reality. 

As long as you learn social cues, and respect everyone's right to say no, you are doing ok. You can't please everyone, and you can do everything right and still have the person see you as a creep. But as long as you do everything right on your end, you got nothing to worry about.

Physical attraction is natural. When you are asking someone out, that's called asking for consent to get know them better. It's not some evil thing that should be avoided just cause one OP says it's wrong, especially when alot of the top awarded comments contradict what OP said.

And when I say flirting, I mean ""hey, how's it going"", not ""damn, that ass is fine"" in case any of you try to strawmen what I mean when I say striking up a conversation and escalating to something ""flirty"".

In case you didn't know, you can wear shoes to keep your feet clean, dry, and supported throughout the day.

Hear me out. Shoes come in lots of different sizes and styles, and are designed for different purposes. You can find them at most big-box stores, and some retail outlets even specialize in selling shoes exclusively.

In the U.S., some of the most commonly worn shoes out there include sneakers, also called tennis shoes, which are great for walking or running long distances and have great support so you don't wear down your bones or whatever as you age. Don't worry though, you don't have to play tennis to wear them!

If you work in an office, they make shoes from leather that are kind of dressy and allow you to look professional because walking around barefoot is considered rude or unhygienic by some stiffer traditional types. Shoes are also great for traction for those who work in buildings, like nurses or service staff because they prevent you from sliding around and studies have shown they can increase service productivity by almost 47% just because you can walk faster than when you're barefoot or in socks (stay tuned for my next post after karma stops coming in from this one and I'll deep dive into sock insights. It's gonna be darn educational).

Likewise, if you work outdoors or are always on the go, there are types of shoes called ""boots"" that will protect your feet from water and dirt, and also from falling objects and stray debris at your job site. If your site manager doesn't require employees to wear boots and you're nervous of how they might react, don't sweat it--you can contact your local OSHA representative and get special permission to wear boots in case the issue is brought up with your regional manager. It's also helpful to know your way around boots when it comes time for annual reviews so you know how to lick your boss's properly.

Some other tips:

\- You don't have to wear shoes all the time, like when you're sleeping. In fact, lots of people still sleep barefoot, so don't worry too much about committing 100% to something new if you're not ready for it.

\- If you're in the United States, you can wear shoes inside other people's houses! Remember what I said about traction--it's much easier to walk around when you can easily grip the ground. Think about how much dogs and cats slip around on wooden floors. You don't have live like an animal!

Anyway, I hope that was helpful for you. Now give me the karma I am due.",LPT: Wear shoes to protect your feet

My friend lives in another state and we had been planning to try and meet up and travel somewhere together, have him visit me or vice versa. We came to the conclusion that I would visit him about two months ago, but in his parents house instead of his place. (They live in different states) Then last week he asked if I could possibly switch my flight to come to his place because there was an event that was going on that he thought was cool. He also mentioned in his hometown how he wasn't very familiar with it and didn't really go out much there. After looking I found out my airline doesn't go to his city. When I told him that he asked if I could possibly ask the airline to move the date I departed to the following week for free so that he could attend the event. I was a little irritated because I had already planned to come that week and already hate dealing with airlines because I've never booked a flight before so I'm not really familiar or fond of all the protocol, long holds (etc). that come with booking or canceling flights. But I agreed to check in. I called and found out that I was being charged an extra 130 dollars on top of my original payment of 160. The agent never properly explained this to me. Instead I thought the new price of my ticket was 130 (with a fee of 59 bucks for changing) which I didn't mind. After calling and going back and forth for an hour with the airline agents I managed to have them reduce the price to around 220 dollars. So when I informed my friend he said I shouldn't have paid and  that he never intended for me to pay anything and that he only wanted me to ask if they'd switch it for free and that regardless of what happened he would have been there whenever I was able to come.

This “shyness” in my view was simply an anxiety disorder. I now take meds for depression and anxiety as well as adhd, and more. 

Don’t believe the horror stories about antidepressants…I have never once felt like a “Zombie” on these, they just give you a base happiness level you can more easily live with. The anxiety medication helps with not having as much social awkwardness and social paranoia for example.

To be honest though, the best medicine I take is the ADHD medication. It wakes you up and has you feeling 100% ready, refreshed, and focused, much more effectively than coffee ever did for me. The reason for this is pretty obvious: It’s a stimulant (amphetamine/dextroamphetamine) and this gives euphoria and focus.

LifeProTips,/r/LifeProTips/comments/ttacdp/lpt_always_try_to_fight_the_speeding_ticket/,"On Christmas Day, I got a speeding ticket driving to my parent's house for breakfast. It sucked especially since I had just spent quite a bit on presents for my family and was also transitioning to a new job. 

It was raining, and the cop that pulled me over was quite a bit in front of me and was also driving. I was speeding but was at the speed limit again by the time I was about 5 car lengths or so behind him. Despite this, he pulled back behind me and pulled me over anyway. I ended up getting a hit with a fine for about $300-400 + traffic school.

Now here is the part I didn't know, it only cost me $99 to get a lawyer and so far my lawyer pleaded not guilty for me on Valentine's Day (my court date lol) and now my case is on hold for possibly the next 6+ months. So not only do I not have to pay for my ticket or go to traffic school anytime soon, but I actually have a good chance of winning my case.

FYI the officer that gave you the ticket has to show up to the case and show evidence to prove the conviction otherwise the case is dismissed. If this case is dismissed, you avoid points on your record, traffic school, fines, insurance increases, etc. and this was all for $99. 

Reasons for a lawyer:

* More time to get money for the ticket if you do lose
* Possibility of reduced fine
* Potential Errors on Ticket = dismissal
* Radar Gun/Traffic camera can't be proven to have correct calibration when the ticket was issued = dismissal
* You were going above the speed limit because of safety reasons like to avoid an accident = reduced fines or dismissal
* Officer got the wrong car = dismissal
* Officer didn't have a clear view = dismissal
* You have already used your traffic school or you already have points on your record and cant have another ticket

So in the case that you do get pulled over, make sure you know what the officer is stopping you for, write down details of everything in the moments before getting pulled over(surroundings, where the cop was, where you were pulled over, if something effected your ability to follow traffic laws, etc), and don't argue with the cop.

LifeProTips,/r/LifeProTips/comments/tt9x4v/lpt_you_can_change_what_ads_target_you_across_the/,"We see ads everywhere we go on the internet, and while many people get served ad content they like since the ads are targeted to our interests, it can be problematic when you're being served ads for things you don't want to be tempted by. 

For example, maybe you're trying to lose weight but getting hit with fast food ads. Or you're trying to stop drinking but you're consistently shown ads for alcoholic beverages. Or perhaps you had a pet die, but you keep getting shown ads for pet products and it's bumming you out. 

The good news is that you can change what ads you are shown fairly easily.

A large portion of ads we see on the net (\~30%) are served directly from Google, and a good many others buy their data from Google. Ad data is personalized on a per-user basis based on what a person searches for, what sites they visit, what content they interact with, etc.

Google allows you to directly see what they know/assume about you, and what your interests are. They (and advertisers) use this to influence what ads are shown to you. Thankfully, they also allow you to mark items as not being of interest to remove you from the ad pool. But don't think of it as altruism on Google's part- they want their ads to be more effective, and so if you self-select what you're interested in then they can advertise to you more efficiently. 

To view and update your Google ad interests, click here and turn off any ""interests"" you don't want to see ads for:  [https://adssettings.google.com/](https://adssettings.google.com/) 

That will impact ads you see across a huge number of places on the internet, and will give you some control back on what is being shoved in your face constantly.

Also, anytime you see an ad for something you don't want advertised to you, check to see if the platform has a button for ""Why am I seeing this ad?"" (ex fb and ig). Click it, then select ""I do not want to see this again"". Repeated use of that tool will influence advertisers behavior since they won't want to waste money showing ads to people that aren't interested.",LPT: You can change what ads target you across the internet with a few simple clicks

•Yes, you should have a diet with healthy foods and fiber (vegetables, etc.), but it's equally important to make sure you drink lots of water so your body can digest the fiber better (prevents stool from becoming too dry/hard, which can lead to straining). Water is key.
•The goal of the first tip is to get your stool soft enough so you won't need to push while pooping. Do not push! This can lead to hemorrhoids. 
•Don't bring your phone or a magazine into the bathroom and distractedly sit on the toilet for 10+ minutes. Too much time on the toilet can put pressure on the veins in your rectum, which can lead to hemorrhoids. The goal is to get in and get out as quickly as your movement is over.

However, there's only so much that any of us can do (short of enforcing a call whitelist which is probably the most robust method available but which is also problematic if, like I, you run your own business and occasionally need to field calls from unknown callers).

Over the years, I've developed a few common defenses - one of which I see was just posted on this sub.

Because I am an English speaker living in a non-English-speaking country I have an easy go-to in pretending to only speak English and not the local language. 

If that fails, I have memorized how to say ""I only speak Norwegian"" in Norwegian - assuming that the likelihood of the telespam caller happening to be a Norwegian must be vanishingly small. I recommend that everybody have this phrase on hand in whatever language is sufficiently obscure in the part of the world in which you live. 

But what if you pick up a call only to discover within seconds that it's a telesales spammer trying to sell you on marketing research?

Frequently I just hang up and then block the number. But sometimes one wants to hear the person out just a little longer. In other instances, one simply doesn't want to be so callous.

My new go-to for these situations is to pretend to be a gatekeeper to myself. 

I use the name of a non-existent personal assistant and say that I will bring the message to the attention of me ""if it is of interest"" -- which makes me feel slightly better because that part isn't a lie at least. Given that there's a 99% chance that whatever they're selling isn't of interest I won't be passing it on -- to myself. 

The sales caller now assumes I hope that they've gotten through to a PA with no purchasing power and I of course never pass on anything.

I always thought that the people who went all the way to end of lane were real jerks, who tried to skip a few cars instead of merging early. TIL, I was dead wrong.

The Texas Transportation Institute conducted a study and concluded that zipper merges are actually faster, safer, and more efficient than merging early, especially when there's traffic. Zipper merging is where each car works collaboratively to allow one car from the right lane to merge left to form one line, just like in a zipper. In some places like Illionois and countries like Germany, zipper merges are law! 

Why is this faster? Because traffic buildups often occur when cars in the merging lane aren't given space  to merge, thereby bringing all the cars in that lane to a total standstill. When these cars then try to merge from a dead stop onto the path of oncoming traffic, they often cause collisions! Zipper merging means that both lanes are fully utilized and the vehicles in the merging lane can carry their speed into the highway. 

Merging early also leaves the right lane empty for some idiot on the highway to use as a shortcut, which is both dangerous and incredibly annoying. So now you know, cars at the merge point aren't trying to cut in line last minute, you NEED to let them in.",LPT: Always zipper merge onto congested highways.

1. Stop having FOMO. That 30% off is tempting, but don't buy clothes solely based on price. Try it on. Take photos of what you like and go home. You might find for cheaper online or maybe they'll actually have it in your size. If you're still thinking about that item a few days later, then go buy it. 


2. You want the best deal? Do your research. Use Google Lens to search for similar looking items in other clothing lines. Check second hand online retailers like Poshmark and ThredUp. Buy things towards the very tail-end of the season for the best deals. Avoid fall/holiday shopping.


3. Choose appropriate fabric. Expensive clothes need expensive maintenance or you will ruin them and waste all your money. You don't need to use silk pajamas, cotton is more durable and can be easily washed (imo). 


4. Shoes are the one item where you never want to buy one size bigger or smaller. Not talking about how different brands size differently. But never purposely try on shoes and buy a size up, thinking ""you'll grow into it"" or ""close enough""...You could twist an ankle that way. 

5. Find a tailor or learn to do some basic alterations. Everyone's body is different, and you won't find stuff off a rack that was designed to fit you. There's always something. In most cases, for a pant, get the hips to fit and everything else can be fixed. For a shirt, make sure the chest and sleeves aren't too tight, you can fix everything else.",LPT: Buying clothes?

LifeProTips,/r/LifeProTips/comments/trapw3/lpt_when_in_an_argument_with_a_loved_one_or_peer/,"\*Edit: formatting\*



This is a trick for situations when you find yourself in an argument with a loved one or peer that you trust is, at least, not a complete narcissist (for whom this trick won’t work).

&amp;#x200B;

Arguments break down and become unresolvable when each side is focused only on vindicating themselves. To that end, some times arguments seem like a competition for resources, with both sides trying to “take, take, take.” People are way more willing to fairly consider your side of the argument if you cooperate with them by first offering consideration of their side. So, when attempting to argue your side, begin with acquiescing some aspect of their argument first. First “give”, **then** “take”. Template:

&amp;#x200B;

“I can see how \*insert some aspect of their side you’re willing to concede\*. I just also think that \*insert some aspect of your side you want them to acknowledge\*.”

&amp;#x200B;

Offer one for them, ask for one for yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

In an argument, it **does not matter who is more correct, pragmatically. What matters is what can come out of the argument constructively. When you focus too much on your side being right, and their side being wrong, the argument is only destructive**. For this reason, appealing to each other’s psychology by offering respect will cut through the toxicity like a hot knife through butter.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

And, before any the comment says “LPT Be mature/a good person”, even good/mature people find themselves sucked into toxic arguments and struggle to navigate the best ways out.

During the festive season I had an opportunity to talk with my grandfather and asked him a lot of questions. Which made me realise what could be the potential cause of the way I live. Therapy wasn't working because we couldn't figure out the root course of the problem. My grandfather never worked, has no friends no interest. He spends his time inside the house (want to live alone) and occasionally if it's too hot sit outside. This is a life I see myself leaning towards. At least he does this consciously. My sister is like this also. I don't know if they enjoy their lives because I don't and I don't see myself living like this my whole life. I'm in college, being in college from where I'm from is a blessing and I have seen my capabilities and things I could achieve. My goal and dreams are possible but the only thing stoping me is these days that are unaccounted for. 

What I'm asking for with this are tips you think might help me. Live everyday.

Obviously I’m still hungry. So I downloaded the door dash app and ordered the EXACT same meal and it was $10 more!! I’m a first time user and got a $2.99 delivery fee waver and it’s MORE money for the EXACT same order? How is this possible?

Here is the answer…

They raise the price of each food item in the Door Dash app for the exact same food you can buy on the restaurant’s website and get delivered by the same company DOOR DASH. This is even with the delivery fee included.

LifeProTips,/r/LifeProTips/comments/tqgtbl/lpt_diets_are_for_health_not_weight_loss_heres/,"First of all, a diet is just what you tend to eat, it has nothing to do with losing weight. What I’m referring to is ‘diets’ like paleo, keto, Atkins, things like that.

Secondly, the only way to lose weight is to burn more calories than you take in. Eating specific foods will not magically make you lose weight.
A calorie is simply a unit of measurement. If you want to LOSE weight, look up/count how many calories are in the food you eat, and weigh yourself consistently. If you’re gaining weight or staying the same, reduce the amount of calories you eat by a small, non dramatic amount. On the other hand, you can add more exercise into your day to burn those calories off.

That’s it. That’s all there is to it.
The ‘trick’, the ‘magic secret’ to weight loss is just finding out how many calories you consume, and reducing it. If you don’t lose weight, reduce more.
The only reason healthier foods are good for weight loss is because they have fewer calories. 
The only reason junk foods are bad for weight loss is because they have high calories.
It really doesn’t matter what you eat.
The only reason exercise is good for weight loss is because it burns calories.
If a fad ‘diet’ says you can lose weight by cutting out these three foods, or adding these three instead, you’re being mislead. Calories in, calories out. Easy as that.

TLDR: The only way to lose weight is to consume fewer calories than you burn. It’s not about the type of food, just the calories. If a diet claims you can lose weight by eating only ‘these certain foods’ they’re misleading you.","LPT: Diets are for health, not weight loss. Here’s how to avoid scams."

This might be because the option to Hibernate has been automatically hidden for most people since the windows 8 days, so you may need to [manually enable it in the control panel](https://www.groovypost.com/howto/enable-hibernate-mode-windows-10/)

Hibernate is essentially just putting your pc to sleep in a way that can survive losing power, combining the benefits of a proper shut down with the convenience of sleep.

The ""trick"" is simple, next time you need to unplug your pc or want to enter the bios:

1. Set your PC to Hibernate in the usual power menu
2. Pull the plug
3. (move your pc or take it apart or whatever you need to do)
4. Plug it back in
5. Power it on (you'll get a chance to enter the bios here)
6. After it posts, Windows will resume normally as if it was waking up from sleep

I'm sure most of us are aware of hibernate, but I figure since the option has been hidden by default for so many years, there are a bunch of new pc users, and it was always sold to us as a power saving feature--it might help some of you.

So I stopped brushing my teeth on a daily basis for a very long time and now all I do is drink squeezed

ORGANIC lemons with distilled water. I don't drink the pasteurized lemon juice in squeeze bottles or

the giant GMO lemons. When I first started this habit I didn't realize how beneficial it would be to my

teeth. I did it because I liked the way it made my teeth feel and also my breath smell. I will probably

floss my teeth every once in a while when I FEEL like its time do so or brush them if need be. Ususally

its weeks or even months in between and my girlfriend doesn't think my breath smells bad at all. Their

was a time before when I used to brush my teeth everyday and floss and eat a lot of sweets I would

always wake up with morning breath and my teeth just didn't feel that rigid or strong. Ever since I

have started living this way my teeth not only feel stronger but look healthier as well. The reason I

made this post is because everywhere I look on the internet about drinking lemon water it says TO

NOT DO IT. It will strip your enamel and blah blah blah. I think a lot of the cons that come with

drinking lemon water come from mixing it with tap water which is filled with GOD KNOWS WHAT. If

you want to learn more about what is in your local tap water go here

([https://www.ewg.org/tapwater/](https://www.ewg.org/tapwater/)) and just punch in your zip code. THe 50x, or 60x just means that is

how much extra of that chemical is in your tap water beyond the recommended government limits.

Also, I don't think the stuff we brush our teeth with is very healthy for us either. They put fluoride in

the toothpaste. I mean seriously how does that even make sense that we are doing this to ourselves

and accepting it as rational behavior. Honestly the proof is in my own personal experience. I just

wanted to share this with people who are afraid to drink lemon water. Just make sure you mix the

organic lemon juice with DISTILLED water. I squeeze one lemon into a 24 oz cup and if I decide to get

more water I will squeeze another lemon so usually I only drink 1 to lemons a day. Their is no harm in

doing so. Experiment for yourself. The toothpaste and tapwater will do more harm to your body than

drinking lemon water IMO. Have a great day everybody and thanks for reading.",LPT I drink distilled lemon water everyday

LifeProTips,/r/LifeProTips/comments/tppa1v/money_guide/,"The only thing you HAVE to do with money is to spend it on your needs wants, your food, upkeep, entertainment, travel, goods and services, living expenses, rent.

A LIABILITY is NOT an item you can buy. A liability is DEBT. try not to purchase debt, wherever possible try not to buy credit. you have to pay interest on it. YOU take on the risk of insolvency. Debt grows exponentially. if you don't pay regularly, it will go to infinity. causing bankruptcy.

UNLESS that credit is funded for by a business. Businesses have profit but could also go insolvent or take losses, business owners take on risk, inherently. The share or stock of the business you buy takes on the risk of insolvency. Think of a house as a low risk business. the share of stock of the business is the house price, the net profit of the business is the rent cost, minus any taxes and upkeep fees, the risk of insolvency is secured by the house (the share of stock). Higher risk businesses generally produce better yield (return on investment). You may purchase shares in any kind of business, doesn't have to be a house as long as you are willing to take on the risk and grow it to make a profit as an entrepeneur, you can take home profits after paying all employees and costs, or you can reinvest those profits to further grow the capacity of the business. on the other hand you may purchase stock of publicly traded business, this is equivalent to owning a share of a business passively. you may receive a dividend if the business continues to be profitable, or if the business reinvest their profit and grows, then the stock price will go up with the share price, and you may sell at a profit minus fees. investing or trading in exchanges of stocks is literally the same thing as trading shares of businesses, except the share isn't determined by the ACTUAL value of the share, it is determined by supply and demand (publically traded). Traders assume that the market is efficient enough to figure out the share price accurately and fairly, meaning as share goes up positive correlation, stock price goes up. and the companies benefit from the extra public capital from investment. it can be risky, but through statistics and intelligence, you can control that risk by reducing volatility and increasing probability of success and increasing profitability with respect to some target in time/indicator. this is what stock traders do.

Money goes down in value with respect to the same goods and services, except in a recession,  this is inflation. only in a recession do you want to keep money.

so you will want to purchase ASSETS/business with spare money. this is risky, but is the only way to really make money. except for working. working is a situation where you yourself are an asset.

the other thing you may do with money is put it into savings accounts and make interest from it, this holds almost zero risk but you don't have freedom to change your mind and control and your money is locked in.

the other thing you may want to do with spare money is spend on bonds. this is to interest what public stocks are to private shares. bonds are essentially interest payment plans, except the price of the payment plan is decided by the free market. you would expect as the interest rate goes up, people will want to lend their money on other plans, so the bond price sells for a lower price. negative correlation.

the other thing you may want to do with spare money is spend on commodities. commodities can be liquid fungible like gold, silver, other currencies, bitcoin, oil or non fungible and non liquid, like paintings and watches. you may want to hold a significant portion of these, but you will more likely want to actively trade them than just hold them. they could rise or fall in value with respect to your currency. it is notoriously more difficult to make money by investing in other currencies (forex) than it is to buy stocks of business. they do not lose their value, but their value can fluctuate.

Ex1, Scenario: your partner has been emotionally distant, and has not been spending ample/meaningful time with you.

You statements with absolutes: ""*You're always* pushing me away these days. *You never* want to spend time with me. *You* *only* hang out with me when you have nothing better to do"" 

I statement with minimal absolutes, we-statements, focusing on emotions: ""Lately, I've been feeling far away from you.  **When** the only time *we* spend together is at the very end of the day, **it makes me** ***feel*** like *our time together* happens only after *we* are done with everything else. That makes me feel like spending time together isn't a priority *we share*, and *I am hurt when this happens in our relationship*. I'm feeling lonely and abandoned, and I don't want to feel this way...Is everything ok with you? I'm wondering if you're pulling away because something else is happening. I want to understand if you're struggling with something, either within or outside of our relationship. *I am here for you.*""

Ex2, Scenario: your partner continues to put dirty dishes into the sink, rather than directly into the dishwasher.

You statements with absolutes, and character assassination: *""You never* put the dishes into the dishwasher, no matter how many times I've asked. Are you a child? Am I your parent? I don't understand why you can't just do this simple task, it drives me crazy.""

I statements with no absolutes: ""**When** you put your dishes in the sink, rather than load them into the dishwasher, **then I feel** like you're expecting me to put them away for you. *That makes me feel like you don't respect me*. *The story I'm telling myself* is that it's a simple task that you're choosing not to do on purpose. I trust that you're not actively trying to disrespect me, but it still feels disrespectful. It feels like you don't care about how this impacts me, and that isn't a good feeling. I don't want to feel this way with you... What are your thoughts? How can we work together to address this?""

Ex3, Scenario: your partner has not been physically affectionate, nor have you had sex in quite some time.

You statements with absolutes, contempt and criticism: ""We haven't had sex in ages. *You never* touch me, do you even want me? Am I just that repulsive to you? You don't put *any* effort into our sex life. *I feel like I'm married to a fish*"".

I statements without absolutes: ""Lately, I'm starting to feel like you don't want to be close to me. *We* haven't been physically connecting *very often*, *we* haven't hugged or kissed *a lot*, and *we* haven't had sex *in a while*. **When** we aren't physically affectionate with each other, **I feel** scared that you don't want me. Right now, I'm feeling rejected and I don't want to feel this way with you... Can I ask, why do you think this is happening in our relationship? I want to understand your perspective so we can address this together. I want to fix this as a team.""

Using I-statements, We-statements, focusing on the emotional impact of behavior, and avoiding absolutes are essential factors to a **soft start up.** When we start hard conversations softly, with centering our *experience*, rather than feigning to have a factual interpretation of what's 'actually' happening, it's easier for someone to respond empathetically. Absolutes open the door *immediately* to defensiveness, because it's an invitation to argue about whether that is *always* happening or *never* happening. It's also easier to be critical or contemptuous towards our partner when we utilize you-statements, rather than I-statements. I-statements center the discussion on the emotional reality of one person, and invite the other person to empathize with them. We-statements infuse conversations with a sense of partnership, teamwork, and reminds the other of the shared goals. Always build understanding first: What are each of you feeling? What is each person's perspective? *Only when both parties feel understood is it time to problem solve, and remember, sometimes the only solution needed is to feel understood.*

However, be aware that unfounded mandates can push costs onto poorer school districts or municipalities further burdening their already strained budgets and tax base. When deciding whether to support legislation, make sure you understand how it will be paid for. One of the most recent examples was the No Child Left Behind Act enacted under George W. Bush. Some of the provisions were unfunded leading to lower income districts struggling to comply while also being held to the same strict standards of wealthy districts.

I put in my 30 day notice at a hospital working in general surgery as an RN. Decided to protest with signs due to none of my requests to fix equipment, raise wages, increased on call shifts, and addressing staff issues over the months.

I finally have a meeting with HR and raise all of these patient safety concerns. Their only concern was using the buzz word “patient safety” to address short staffing, no breaks, etc. They didn’t care about fixing anything meaningful. The are worried about the chain of command and keeping their job like good little sheep. 

That night HR calls and they accepted my resignation 2 days in, and said they would pay me the remainder of the 28 days. Well, 2 months later, last week, I call, and they have nothing on file about paying me. 

They got me out of the way to protect the company from lawsuits, and creating too much noise addressing all of the things you hear about with employee retention, mental health, increased shifts, and patient safety.

Hospitals should not be run solely by business men/women. Healthcare is a different animal, and lives are on the line. Keeping labor costs down and profits up should not be a priority.

Assets like property, land, stocks/shares, digital assets are likely to increase in value. If you invest $100 today, it might be $110 in a year or $120 in 2 years.

LifeProTips,/r/LifeProTips/comments/toj72e/lpt_happiness_can_never_be_given_it_must_be/,"Many desire to be happy, but not all are able to achieve it, and fewer still to maintain it. A lot of people expect happiness to appear before them, whether in the form of friends, a promotion at work, or a winning lottery ticket, and they focus on attaining these things as if it would solve most of their problems and make them truly happy.

Many things do make people happy of course, for almost everyone has hobbies or things that make them smile. But this happiness is often transient, with many losing it once the moment ends. Thus, the happiness that many desire is not happiness per se, but oftentimes contentment instead, when you are simply happy for what you have and where you are in life.

Being content does not mean a lack of ambition or a desire for change, but rather it is a state of acknowledging that what you have is already enough for you as a person. Although easy to say, it can be very difficult to achieve, for a minimum of 3 things must first be accomplished.

The first is minimum, or the absolute necessities needed for a reasonably comfortable lifestyle. No matter how positive one's outlook may be, maintaining happiness when one does not know when the next meal will be, or whether or not there will be a roof over one's head by nighttime, is extraordinarily difficult. However, once this minimum requirement is met, then any additional resources may grant increased opportunities for happiness, but far from guarantees it.

The second requirement is meaning. A life without hope, or one without meaning, is a life yet lived. Meaning is what motivates us, and hope is what allows us to keep moving forward. It is what allows us to feel that we matter, that we can actually make a difference in this vast world. In the end few may achieve their dreams, but hard work betrays little, and the act of striving towards a goal is in itself often what makes life worth living.

The third requirement is mindset, and this is most important of all. No matter how much one may possess, no matter how few obstacles or hardships they may face, if one does not have the right mindset then happiness may never be achieved. Despite what many might think, mindset is not as simple as comparing yourself to those less fortunate however, for the same argument could be used to claim that one could always compare themselves to those more fortunate. Instead, a proper mindset is being able to see the value of everything you might have or experience. It could be as significant as a mother's love, to something as small as a stranger holding open a door for you, for both of those actions acknowledge you as a person - that you exist and that you matter.

Happiness is not straightforward, and it is different for everyone, but happiness itself can never be given. Affluence may satisfy the first requirement, and offer opportunities for the others, but it cannot guarantee them. Meaning may be suggested, taught, or even granted, but unless it is borne from the heart of the individual carrying it, will never be genuine, and with mindset being similar. Thus, happiness is not given but found by the one that seeks it.

Happiness requires a conscientious effort, it must be grasped, and it begins with the letter M (minimum, meaning, mindset).

Thank you for entertaining my perspective. I am sure many may feel differently, and I recognize that happiness is much more complicated than this, but these are my personal ramblings and I hope that it may help others.","LPT: Happiness can never be given, it must be grasped by the person that desires it"

Casual disclaimer that this isn't medical advice nor is it a guarantee to work it's just something I discovered that helps me and it might help you.

Anyway...I have tinnitus. It's not noticeable until I'm in a quiet place, or trying to fall asleep. Then it can feel like my ears are ringing very very loudly, as though I can hear a constant high pitched ambulatory /emergency tone.

It used to really bother me until one night, while I was sleeping, I thought to try to see if I could still hear pure silence even if my ears were ringing. Not sure what made me think to try, but what I did was I switched from passive listening to active listening, and focused on my ear drums, and I tuned out the noise like it was background static and tried to detect any sound at all. Sure enough, the ""tone"" of tinnitus began to shift from inside my eardrum directly, into the back of my head. I began to realize that the noise I was hearing was more of a response to ear damage, than an actual sound I could hear. So while I had the tone inside my skull, just to the left / right of my ear, I began to breath slowly and concentrate. I imagined that there was a ""volume dial"" in my brain to ""turn down"" the volume of my tinnitus. It sounds crazy...but it worked. The one was significantly reduced, and I was able to briefly trick my brain into only hearing silence. 

Sometimes, the ringing comes back, but every time I try this technique it either gets rid of the tone, or is able to ""turn it down"" significantly. I feel like by concentration, meditation, and active listening for noise instead of passive listening when I hear tinnutus, I've been able to teach my brain to distinguish between ""imaginary internal noise"" and legitimate environmental sounds.

Give it a try and see if it works!",LPT: You can significantly reduce Tinnitus by teaching your ears through meditation to differentiate between legitimate and imagined noise

However, the one thing they were not the greatest at while I was growing up is they reacted harshly to many things I did wrong, with harsh punishments and stern talking-to’s rather than helping me try to work through my problems and let me grow from them. Every time they caught me messing up, they came down pretty hard on me. They probably thought that harsh punishments would ensure I would never get into trouble, but it really just made me hide things from them instead. I never had gotten into anything illegal or bad, just smaller things like bad grades in highschool for a semester or stuff like that. 

Nevertheless, it taught me that if you want your kids to come to you when they need help, try to help them work through something than punish them into the ground. Otherwise, you will always be the “last resort” at best to a problem they have rather than the first solution that you want to be. If they see you as a mentor rather than a judge, it will totally change the way they interact with you.

Hello,   
 

I am approaching a job offer soon and wanted to know if I can negotiate (maybe) a higher salary if they don’t meet my expectation, a higher performance bonus and also a sign on bonus?   
 

The offer I currently expect for a senior Finance Analyst: 112k - 115k base, and 10% performance bonus.   
 

What I want to counteroffer with: 115k base, 15% performance bonus, and also a 15k sign on bonus.   
 

Reasons behind my counteroffer: I have interviewed with other companies (some of which were in the same industry and some not) a good number of them said that the 115k base, 15% performance bonus were within the range and had no issues meeting that so I am using these other companies as a benchmark behind my counteroffer. Also seems that from my research for the specific area/industry/job what I want to ask for is reasonable.   
 

Reasons behind the sign on bonus: If I leave my current company I will be missing out on about 18k worth of performance bonus + profit sharing from the current company so I want to make up with the sign-on bonus I plan to ask for.   
 Is that a reasonable request? or maybe I should ask for more/less sign on bonus ?   
 

I’d like to hear your insights and thoughts when it comes to negotiating.

LifeProTips,/r/LifeProTips/comments/tmiz3m/lpt_request_what_to_do_when_encountering_cars/,"So I’m sure everyone has been through this scenario: you’re driving on a 2 lane highway, and you come up to 2 slow cars ahead of you in both lanes that drives side to side next to each other going the same speed leaving no room or chance for drivers behind them to pass. Well this is quite common in bigger busy cities where driver awareness is just non existent. But where I live, a much more peaceful and small community, where things like this just doesn’t happen. I always call my town the “American autobahn” because 99% of drivers move to the right lane when they see cars coming up behind and they know they’re slow. It’s incredible. But still I’ve actually had encountered a situation like this at the beginning of the year, where I was driving on a 2 lane mountain highway and the sedan ahead of me in the left lane was obvious trying to block me/traffic from overpassing. Because every time there’s a driver on the right lane, he’d start driving EXACTLY the same speed as the other driver, blocking the lane. It was obviously intentional. There was even a semi that he tried to drive the same speed with. But it didn’t work out long, because both times the other drivers probably got annoyed and weirded out that there’s a car continuously driving next to them, so the other drivers eventually slowed down, leaving room and space for me to overtake the idiot. However, on my way to work today, this same thing happened again. And I’m sure it was intentional too. Because when I was trying to merge onto the highway, there’s this car that just had to get ahead of me in the merging lane, refusing to yield. And then after getting ahead of me, he immediately moved to the left lane, which is something he could’ve done before the lane merged. But that’s fine, I don’t really care. So I was driving behind him in the left lane, and there’s traffic on the right lane. As soon as the traffic cleared on the right lane, he moved to the right lane and started driving exactly the same speed as the slow car now ahead of me. Keeping in mind this was very obvious that he’s doing it on purpose because he was suddenly slowing down to match the speed of the slow driver ahead of me. Leaving no room for me to pass or overtake. And I thought, that’s fine, the car ahead of me will probably move over just like usual. Boy I was wrong, the car ahead of me in the left lane just continued driving in the left lane, having no intention of moving over nor does he seem bothered with the fact that there’s a car driving right next to him all this time. And you could tell the idiot on the right lane was doing it on purpose even more so because every time the car ahead of me slowed downed a bit, or sped up a bit, that’s what he would do as well. I got really pissed, this lasted for about 1.5 miles before I was able to exit. I was close to honking the horn but remembered that my family always told me these people has empty lives and just wanted someone to play games with them. So I didn’t.

LifeProTips,/r/LifeProTips/comments/tm8tnk/lpt_some_perspective_on_the_housing_market/,"I'm writing this for those who are feeling overwhelmed, frustrated, defeated, angry, or generally just anxious about the current state of the housing market in the US.  I'm also writing this for those who are curious (morbidly so?) about what is going on, how we got here, and where it is going. 

HOUSING CYCLES  
Housing prices tend to follow boom and bust cycles.  Boom cycles are characterized by soaring prices and massive demand.  During bust cycles, plenty of housing is available for sale, but no one wants to buy, people are afraid to buy, or can not afford to buy it.  Over a long enough time frame, housing prices have historically appreciated, but it is not a linear process.  In my lifetime as an adult, there have been two big busts which saw housing prices drop significantly (the 2008 financial crisis and the immediate years after and for like *three to nine months* when COVID hit in 2020) and two big booms (the years leading up to 2008, and late 2020 through March 2022 as I write this).

It's important to note that the above analysis of housing cycles is WAY TOO GENERAL, because housing is predominately a LOCAL market issue.  A boom in the NYC market may coincide with a bust in the Detroit housing market.  The pain (or euphoria sometimes, but it's mostly pain) felt by local people trying to buy or rent locally  is unique to each locality.  Media tends to publish lots and lots of articles trying to generalize the problem nationally (because people like to read these articles and that's just what news media does), but no two *local markets* experience the same thing.  Some experience busts while others boom, and vice versa.

WHAT IS GOING ON?  
Even though each housing market is different, the price of housing in each market follows some  balance of SUPPLY and DEMAND.  Below are some specific issues related to the current state of housing in the US that are contributing in different proportions to the current boom in housing prices experienced in many markets.

DEMAND ISSUES  
1 - Interest Rates:  Interest rates have a very strong effect on what a buyer can afford to spend on housing.   Interest rates were kept near zero for much of the last ten years.  Eventually, more buyers have grown capable of affording to spend more on housing.  Prices have risen according to the increased demand.  Rising interest rates SHOULD depress demand and prices, as purchasers can afford less.  
2 - Remote Work:  As more companies adopt WORK-FROM-ANYWHERE policies, people who were formerly forced into expensive local housing markets in big cities can now enter a wider variety of local housing markets, driving up demand in local markets to new levels.  You WOULD THINK that this would result in price reduction in big cities, but that hasn't really happened and I don't totally understand why.  Maybe lots of city people just changed cities, resulting in no net loss to demand (NYC to Austin, Austin to LA, LA to NYC)?  
3 - Increased Retirement:  COVID caused an increase in earlier-than-expected retirement and many chose to sell homes in or near higher-priced city markets and move to (formerly) less expensive *retirement* markets.  
4 - Downsizing:  High prices cause some people to sell to ""downsize"", this can particularly drive up the cost of previously ""affordable"" homes as downsizing sellers seek less expensive property (usually as they head for retirement)  
5 - Higher Wages:  People are earning more, WHICH IS GREAT, but that means more people can spend more on rent or enter the housing market, increasing demand for houses.  
6 - Asset Appreciation: The stock market has risen, as have some other risky assets, and that is raising net worth.  It allows asset holders to liquidate those assets and convert it to housing.

SUPPLY ISSUES  
Put simply (and generally), there aren't enough existing homes to feed the demand in many local markets for a few reasons:  
1 - New Construction Supply Always Lags:  This is kind of obvious, but as more people enter a new local housing market, more housing will need to be built.  Houses don't grow overnight, it takes time to build new housing.  
2 - Lack of Construction Labor:  While demand for new home construction is high, labor hasn't expanded at a rate fast enough to meet the demand.  This is slowing the rate of new home construction.  
3 - Lack of Construction Materials: Construction materials are hard to come by and are expensive due to demand and supply chain issues.  This slows down construction and increases construction costs.  
4 - Legislation/Policies:  I'm not an anti-regulation guy.  I think regulations are necessary, but regulation tends to make it more difficult and expensive to build housing.  It's also very hard to craft good legislation that doesn't have unintended consequences.  Some areas (think major cities, California, etc.) are more heavily regulated.  To build anything, a developer is going to need an army of lawyers to get anything done.  Whenever armies of lawyers are involved, things tend to get a whole lot more expensive and move a whole lot slower.

WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT  
1 - Be Patient and Have Perspective:  When prices are soaring, markets go crazy and people think *it's never going to end, this time is different, government please do something!*  When prices are crashing, people panic and think *the world is coming to an end, this time is different, government please do something!*  Prices boom and bust.  The best thing you can do is have your finances is good shape so you can act when the market *eventually* turns and prices are in your favor.  Housing purchases tend to be coming later and later in peoples' lives.   Interest rates are starting to rise again which should have a significant effect on prices and demand in time.  You are not screwed if you didn't buy a house in your 20s or 30s.  I know this is cold comfort for those who are facing severe housing pressure right now, but be as patient as you can be.  
2- Be Mobile:  Housing prices should NOT be booming everywhere by the same amount.  There should be markets where housing is affordable.  If your job is mobile, and you don't have family commitments restricting your mobility, you can explore other markets that may be more favorable.  
3 - Don't Obsessively Consume Media Related to Housing:  Contemporary News Media is kind of designed to grab your attention and hold onto by any means necessary - scaring you or provoking your outrage is one of its primary tactics. Endless doomscrolling is not going to help your mental state.  
4 - Rely on Yourself:  Your ability to earn a living is the most important aspect of your financial outlook.  Earning more and saving more now puts you in a better position to enter the housing market later.  
5 - (For current renters) Build a Good Relationship With Your Landlord:  Landlords really value GOOD TENANTS.  A good tenant always pays on time, doesn't trash the place, never has cops called, etc.  The better relationship you can build with your landlord, the more they will want to keep you as a tenant, rather than risking bringing a tenant who will pay more, but might be totally awful.  This is obviously harder if your landlord is a large building corporation than an individual, but you can still be cool to the staff and people you interact with.  People are were may more likely to give you a good deal if they like you than they are if you are pain (unless they are shady and exploitative).

I would appreciate your thoughts of my situation.

I’m going through so many thoughts right now (undergrad college student), mainly relating to friends. During the past few months I have been busy because I was trying to spend quality time with some of my family from abroad, whom I don’t see so often by the way (It might have been about 3 years since the last time I’ve seen them). My friends have been inviting me to eat/hang out with them during those past months, but I had declined in a FRIENDLY way because I really did want to spend time with my family, since I barely get to see them. I even told them that I’ve been excited to spend time with my family. That makes sense, right? Wanting to spend quality time with people you don’t see as often, especially if they’re your family?
Well, family has left and went back to their home, which is all the way across the other side of world. I’ve been more free now and I thought my situation from the past few months was understandable and wasn’t a lame excuse, because I truly did cherish family time. Now, whenever the friends are in town, I noticed they barely even acknowledge me or ask if I want to hang out, constantly posting that they’re out (which I used to be with them before family visitation). I had spent time with my friends a couple of time even when I was busy, but often had to decline due to spending time with family; my friends knew that. One of my best friends is also in that group, but it seems that she is leaning more on her other friends for enjoyment.

I found out today,  from a licensed trauma therapist, that when someone tells you they are a sociopath, it may be one of the few times they are telling the truth.  They must be believed and you need to cut ties as quickly as possible,  for your safety. 

Sociopaths don't feel the shame or embarrassment the rest of us would if we were accused of having sociopathic traits. They literally are not capable of feeling most emotions,  although they are adept at mimicking them,  if they feel they can use emotion to gain an advantage over someone. 

In addition to not feeling shame or embarrassment about being a sociopath,  it's an indicator that you may become one of their victims,  if you aren't already.  Sociopaths freely admit they are a sociopath so they can later avoid taking responsibility for their actions.  The victim is then held responsible for the abuse they endured because ""they were warned"" and ""allowed"" the abuse to happen.  

Taking responsibility for their actions or feeling remorse for hurting others is outside the capabilities of sociopaths.  They literally are unable to feel empathy.  So even though they may acknowledge they have hurt you,  they don't care. They are always looking for a personal benefit or advantage and have no issues destroying another person if it benefits them.  

Pay attention to language, as it may be an indicator.  For example,  a sociopath may say ""I apologize"" when they have harmed someone.  But they will not say ""I'm sorry"" for the actions that harmed their victim.  Although it may take someone a bit to catch on,  there is a difference in the two phrases. I apologize is a statement &amp; they feel that is adequate enough to pacify someone.  However,  I'm sorry indicates they are taking responsibility for their actions that caused harm.  Although they're capable of telling people what they think they want to hear and excel at lying,  even a simple statement like I'm sorry can be nearly impossible because they don't accept responsibility and they don't actually feel remorse.","LPT: If someone tells you they are a sociopath, believe them.

LifeProTips,/r/LifeProTips/comments/tkqr3i/lpt_if_certain_raw_fruits_and_vegetables_make/,"
Since I was young I noticed when eating kiwi my mouth became tingly and there was a slight burning sensation. I thought nothing of this because other fruits like pineapple had a similar effect, and I learned that pineapple has a digestive enzyme (Bromelain) that basically breaks your mouth down. I figured something similar was happening with kiwi. 

I mentioned the burning to one of my friends and they agreed with pineapple but said they had never experienced it with kiwi or any of the other things that made my mouth tingle like celery or peaches. An internet dive led me to oral allergy syndrome (OAS). 

Oral allergy syndrome is more common in people with seasonal allergies and the types of foods that cause the symptoms match your allergies (ie there are different sensitivities if you are allergic to grass, birch, or ragweed). Some people describe a tingly sensation like me, others describe an itching or burning. Some people with ragweed allergies also have this effect from certain edibles. 

The tingling goes away if you cook the fruit/veggies. There is no treatment for OAS and as long as the sensation isn’t too unpleasant for most of the allergens you can just keep enjoying.

LifeProTips,/r/LifeProTips/comments/tkl7yy/lpt_being_humble_about_your_successes_and_wins_in/,"As an adult, I think it's important to cultivate something called ""Win Management"", or ""Success Management"". It's basically another way of saying ""being humble."" Humility is one of those unspoken skills we build as people, and a form of emotional IQ.  I feel it goes hand in hand with building confidence in your life as well as building security within yourself. 

As we get older, we may get more wins under our belt. By ""Wins"" I mean achievements that you KNOW would impress people on some level if they knew. Say for example, you get a really nice car, or a nice job/career.  Maybe you've recently lost of weight, etc.  Although it may seem like common knowledge, just carry yourself like you've been there before.  

For example, say some guy recently gets a Lamborghini.  He goes on a date and all he talks about is how great his car is. Then the other person says ""He is too cocky"". What  they really mean is the person tried too hard to use his ""wins in life"" as a means to get people to like him. The guy is basically conveying the message, ""I need you to know I drive that Lambo in order for you to like me and respect me."" Same could be applied for any similar ""high accomplishment(s)"".  

Carry yourself like you don't need to rely on that ""win"" as a crutch to have people like you and respect you. Carry yourself like you don't need to flaunt your wins in someone's face, as if your putting all your eggs into that basket to get people to like you. Let your personality and vibe do that work. Of course, if it gets brought up, talk about that; but don't feel like everything has to ride on your ""wins"" otherwise you are not enough. There's more to your story than that.

Now I'm NOT saying that you shouldn't work hard in life. It's VERY important to elevate ourselves in this life and to take your life VERY seriously because honestly no one else will. Getting more ""wins"" in life is good. But when you get those wins, remember to be tactful and socially aware enough to not feel the need to shove it in people's faces, and move with grace. The more you excel in life, the more you won't even feel the need to flaunt those achievements. I'm not just talking external achievements, but also in loving yourself and developing security with who you are over time.

You can save money on gas by maintaining proper tire pressure and save money on tires because properly inflated tires last longer.

The Department of Transportation figures show that under-inflated tires waste about 5 million gallons of gas *every day* in the United States.

The U.S. Department of Energy says that for every 1 psi missing from your car’s set of 4 tires, you lose 0.1 percent of your gas mileage. (Every psi lost also means that tires wear 10 percent faster.)

By properly inflating your tires, you can improve your gas mileage by up to 3.3 percent. This means that cars getting 30 mpg could see a benefit of about 1 mpg with properly inflated tires. 

This benefit seems small at first, but when combined with tire savings this amounts to a significant sum over time.

LifeProTips,/r/LifeProTips/comments/tjv7ti/lpt_it_doesnt_get_any_better_than_this/,"First job out of school, I was the college-nerd engineer in a rough, union manufacturing facility.  I learned a lot from those days.  One lesson that has stuck with me in the decades since then, and that I have shared countless times with people who I worked with and then who worked for me was this tip.

A guy - we'll call him Jack - was the Maintenance Lead at my plant.  A big, burly, bearded mountain of a guy with a deep voice who was the local union president.  Good guy.  He busted my chops hard but I finally earned a grudging respect from him.  Every time I'd see him I'd ask ""How's it goin, Jack?""  Every time he'd answer ""It doesn't get any better than this!"" with a smile obvious though but hidden behind his prodigious facial hair.

One day I advanced this banter a little further and said ""Man Jack - you always give that same positive answer.  Do you really believe that or do you just want me to shut up and go away?""  He feigned an emotionally hurt look and said I could take solace in knowing if he didn't want me to talk to him, I would never need to wonder about it.

What he said next, though, was the real nugget.  He explained to me that he had barely graduated high school.  Never been good at math, never cared much for reading and didn't get along well with most people because most people are assholes.  And yet, here he was with a 40-hour a week job, owned his own house, had the respect of his peers, interesting people to talk to, and very little stress to deal with.  He said it LITERALLY didn't get any better than THIS JOB, FOR HIM.  He further explained that if he ever thought maybe it should or could get better, it would damn well be on him to explore that and go find out.  Not listen to what his sister's husband told him, not believe what the other union guys were saying about how much better some other job was, but go get it - do it - live it to know if it really was better.  And, for him, he couldn't imagine many ways - with his skills, desires, and values - to be doing much better than he was.  So, he came in every day.  Early.  Made coffee.  And answered anyone who asked how he was doing with ""It doesn't get any better than this.""

It comes up most often for me in work conversations, but I think the gist of the advice is broader than that.  Here are my takeaways:

* Every one of us has finite limits on what we're capable of
* It is possible - even likely - that consistently operating at those limits of capability does not necessarily align with what you'd LIKE to be spending your time on
* It's up to each of us, individually, to work out the math on what the right balance is for us and seek it
* This equation often changes over time, adjust accordingly
* If you THINK you can do better, go effing find out.  There is risk to taking that leap, but every spec of energy you spend on believing you should be doing better is wasted as resentment against actually taking action and finding out
   * Don't talk about it; be about it

I think this advice applies to relationships, personal health, financial freedom, etc.  The principles are similar.  Spend your energy on first understanding what success looks like to you, second on working towards that, finally on making sure you maintain that alignment.

For example, go to hotels dot com to see what is available for a place to stay in whatever city. ""Hotelname City Center"" may be the perfect location, but don't book at hotels dot com. ""Hotelname City Center"" will have a website. Book directly.

The hotel will be happy that they don't have to pay a ""commission"" to the aggregator site and if they don't price match they are stupid and I have never paid more. There is also a chance you may get a room upgrade or food vouchers or some sort of promotion if their profits aren't eroded by the aggregator. If you book through hotels dot com they will very likely not do this. Need to change dates or adjust your reservation for any reason? They are much more likely to help you and maybe not charge stupid fees if you are an actual hotel customer rather than an expedia customer.

This also applies to airlines or vacation planners. By all means use skyscanner or whatever to do a search for flights, but for example if ""Perfectvacationairlines"" turns up as the best price, book the flight at ""Perfectvacationairlines"" and not skyscanner.

These sites make vacation planning a bit easier in some ways but they definitely get their cut from actual vacation providers.","LPT: If you're going on a trip, aggregator sites like tripadvisor or expedia are great to help with planning, but don't use them to book anything."

1. Don't go shopping when you're hungry. Shops use the smell of bread and chocolate (usually from the bakery) to make you buy more food. 

2. If you don't need a lot of things, take a beg instead of a shopping cart. 

3. Create a shopping list and arrange it according to the store's sections (as much as you can). Avoid entering to sections that you don't need to go to. 

4. Look above and below you. Usually the most popular/expensive products will be right in front of your eyes. 

5. Compare prices base on both the price and weight. Don't be afraid to buy unknown brand. In many cases, the food will taste the same. 

6. Sometimes ordering online can be a better option because you don't need to face many of those tricks, and it is easier to compare prices.

I tried everything to solve this problem from willpower (simply not scratching), to balms, medicated shampoos, natural oils, shampooing less often, etc. Using various combinations of these kept the issue manageable but still consistently irritating and occasionally gross.

So ever since, in addition to some other things I mentioned, I’ve been only using cold water on my scalp and nothing else I’ve ever tried has eased the irritation as much.

For many, from a meditative view, boredom is a lapse in paying attention.

My question is, what is the best way for me to handle this? I'm not super familiar with flight change and cancellation policies, and I'm having a hard time interpreting the information.

Would my best option be to wait and change the flight, or should I try and book a second ticket and cancel the one I don't need? What are the factors I need to consider? If this is not something that can easily be answered like this, how can I go about finding out what's the best option?

If you find your start feeling panicky or your pulse starts to race AFTER the anaesthetic injection goes in it is likely to be the adrenaline in the local anaesthetic. You can ask your dentist to make a note on your records to use local anaesthetic without adrenaline in it to make things much more relaxed in future.

Adrenaline (small amount) is used in dental injections along with xylocaine or lignocaine/lidocaine. It’s meant to help reduce bleeding around the site of surgery. It doesn’t actually seem to make much difference to my dentist for me to have it without and I don’t get any of that horrible adrenaline rush any more. The anaesthetic works 100% just as well and seems to work just as quickly. 

This advice has completely changed the way I feel about going to the dentist now. I made the switch 20 or so years ago and went from dreading a visit to happily sitting having root canal completely numb but nice and relaxed. 

I’ve worked as a surgical assistant in the past and I would still recommend having it with adrenaline for skin surgery however.

What I'm referring to is small, friendly favours. Let me give some examples. Say you have a really friendly neighbor who you're on really good terms with. His garage is bordering your back yard and he wants to expand it can fit his new car. He either cannot do it on his property or it would make it much easier if he could expand it from the back (so he wouldn't have to deal with the murder-door-spring).  You're really good buddies, its in the back corner, only 2ft over the line, doesn't bother you, you say yes. Then after five years he sells his property to some real assholes and they decide that since a garage is clearly a more permanent structure, your fence is clearly on their property and you have to move it. Ensue bothersome proceedings and cost.

It could easily be avoided with a simple contract. ""I, the owner of xyz, allow my neighbor John Smith to expand his garage into my property by so much and he and all future owners acknowledge that it is on my property and agree to remove the part that is on my property within a month of receiving a written notice to do so"".

Or, they can't fit their new RV on their property that is bordering your huge field. They ask if they can park it there. Or they want to renovate something and it would be much easier for the builders to access it from your property and they ask for temporary access. Again, a contract, clearly stating what, where and when. You, my dear cousin, can park your RV across the street from your front yard. You, dear neighbor can drive some equipment over my property for the duration of work. If not clearly defined, such temporary arrangements have a nasty habit of becoming permanent and even expanding. Your cousin could park there and so the new owner assumes he can park his three extra trucks on your field. It came with the property. They could access their back yard over your property, surely I can now drive over it whenever I want.

Of course, the best thing to do in such cases is to just sell the land. But sometimes it is really temporary or the other person doesn't have the money or maybe you don't want to sell. If it ever comes to a situation like this, write a contract and get it notarized. It can save you a lot of headaches in the future. And before you think that stuff like this doesn't happen. It does.

I live in Hurricane country and it continues to boggle my mind that people buy a few extra cans of creamed corn and call it their emergency rations. You may be without power for a while and it may be a while longer before you can get real food again. A can of creamed corn a day isn’t going to keep you full or satisfied. 

My current stockpile as a single person (I rotate through and replace), which I hope to last at least a week if needed:

1. At least 2 16 packs of toaster pastries. I eat these daily for breakfast anyway. 

2. Bread and peanut butter. I always have an unopened backup. 

3. Canned beans (and I’m not talking green beans but more like black/kidney/garbanzo and similar) are my main canned staple. They provide protein and slow digesting carbs and will keep you fuller longer. I keep about 10 cans on hand. 

4. Canned tomatoes pair well with the beans and often come seasoned. 10 cans. 

5. A couple cans of peas, green beans, mushrooms and pineapple for variety. Probably only 10 cans total. 

6. Canned meats (chicken and tuna, though salmon/sardines/spam would fall in this category). Again about 10 cans. Protein will keep you full. 

7. Single serving fruit cups. Remember you may not have anywhere to keep your opened cans from going bad. 2 4-packs. 

6. Granola bars, dry cereal, dried fruits and chips/pretzels/cookies. I don’t keep a set number but they are on hand. 

7. When the power comes on and you can cook again, you may very well be sick of canned food, but the grocery store hasn’t restocked and restaurants that are open may be crowded. So, some boxed pasta/rice/other pantry food that requires cooking but not refrigeration is nice to have on hand. 

8. Seasoning. Hot sauce. Packets of salad dressing that don’t need refrigeration. Salt and pepper. You don’t want to eat bland food. Prepare now so you won’t suffer then.

I went to the #1 ranked program in the country in my discipline for graduate school and went to a top 20 program as an undergraduate. People think that the only places you can get a truly excellent education is at one of the top-tier universities in the country. This is not true, and I will tell you why:

Who is teaching you? Professors, of course. How do they become professors? By getting a PhD from a university. This has unexpected implications.

Take a look at the faculty in your major at, let's say, Dartmouth College. You'll see that the faculty all got their PhDs at prestigious institutions -- Harvard, Stanford, Columbia, UCLA, etc.

So you would think, then, that if you are someone who got your PhD at, let's say, UPenn or Harvard, you would end up teaching at a place like Yale or MIT or Cornell, etc.

Nope.

The vast majority of PhDs who come from these high-ranking institutions end up teaching at more middling places: University of Kansas, Lehigh University, Kenyon College, UC-Riverside, etc. Now, it is \*also\* true that a few of them will end up at those top tier places, but this is the exception, not the rule.

Why?

Because there are way, way more graduates of the top-tier PhD programs than there universities at which they can be hired. Imagine a single graduation year, where the top 15 schools each produce 5 PhD graduates. That's 75 people looking for a job. But in a given year, it is unlikely that those 15 schools are hiring any more than 1 new professor. So you'll have 15 of those 75 getting jobs at other top-15 universities -- and the other 60 have to find jobs elsewhere.

So why does all this matter?

If you go to, let's say, Penn State -- a good but not great school -- and take a quick look at the chemical engineering faculty -- you'll find people from MIT, UC Berkeley, etc.

Ok, so?

At almost ANY of the top 120 or so colleges and universities in the country, you will find either some or MANY faculty with absolutely top tier backgrounds. You can find absolutely fabulous faculty at almost any university. The key is that you have actually to show up in office hours, ask them questions, discuss your interests with them, etc. These are people with PhDs, from the best universities in the country, who have been conducting research for years. Absolutely any thought you've ever had about their discipline is likely a thought they have had as well -- this means it is possible to have conversations about things that are enlightening in ways you never thought possible. They will sharpen your thinking, your critical analysis skills, your writing, broaden your worldview, etc.

So rather than agonize over the academic reputation of this place or that, or whether this place or that will ""get you a job"" (that has much more to do with getting an internship while you're in college and doing career-relevant volunteer work), pick a college that \*feels right\* to you. A place where you like the setting, a place you can afford without taking on insane amounts of debt, a place where the people feel like your people, where the kinds of student activities and organizations appeal to you, etc. College is going to cost your 4 years of your life. If you put effort into your experience there, you will get an absolutely top tier education at almost any top 100 university, as they are filled with top-tier brained people, for the most part. So don't sweat that part.","LPT: Don't worry about college rankings, except . . ."

That's actually a massive red flag because it means:

1. Nobody can be bothered to teach new employees full procedures, either because they're not paid to aid others or because nobody actually knows the full process. When working in a factory there are so many processes and workflows and so many people responsible for their own part of these processes. Rarely a single person knows everything.

2. There aren't any theory resources to learn on your own besides actually doing it because the work hours are either stressful, the staff is burnt out, or there's only old staff with practically no worker turnaround, meaning everyone eventually learned their part and there's no longer any need to write manuals, for which the boss won't pay. Also, nobody made learning material for free, which means a bored and even toxic work environment where everyone does what's theirs and doesn't help their peers because they're not paid extra.

3. Months will pass before you'll eventually have a solid grasp on how to actually do all aspects of your job. You'll learn bits from everyone and figure new shit out daily, for too long before being able to fully understand how stuff should work and what are the priorities. Also, being the new guy in a staff of old people as mentioned before would mean everyone will ask you for help with anything to *teach you* but actually they'll use you to do their job.

If some company tells you you'll learn as you go, just get up and leave. Your job will be miserable and you'll be incompetent for months.

1. The average American is sitting on over $100 of unused gift cards/store credit. Gather up all the cards in your household &amp; do a balance check on them. Write down the value on each card &amp; come up with a plan to use them. Or you can sell unused/unwanted cards to site like CardCash or Raise for money!

Millennials are statistically the worst at making use of gift cards/store credit. Make sure you get on it!

2. Check your email inboxes for any e-gift cards you may have received over the years, but forgot about. Just search for “gift card” at the top of your inbox &amp; see what comes up. Do a balance check on all the cards you find. Delete the ones with $0 so they’re out of the way &amp; plan to spend/sell those that do have a balance

This is kind of like finding money in your pants on laundry day. It’s a nice surprise &amp; every little bit helps

3. Call up your bank(s) &amp; credit card companies. Ask them if they can refund any fees (ATM or monthly service) &amp; interest charges

I did this with Wells Fargo &amp; got some money returned

Discover will refund 3 interest charges every 12 months, as well as some ATM fees. They can look at statements from as far back as 7 years to find/return a fee or interest charge

Just call your credit card company &amp; ask them to see what they are able to do for you!

4. Bring your coins to the bank (or local grocery store if they have a coin counter) &amp; exchange them for cash. Some of us are sitting on a lot of coins. I have a close friend who had almost $75 in coins he recently traded in. He used the money on his grocery bill that day. This is win-win as banks &amp; retailers are often short on coins these days

Background / content: (numbers below)

I have been working for my current company for 4 years with a 6 month leave after the first 2 years (left to work at another company before getting an offer from my old manager). After returning to the company and receiving a substantial raise, I was forced to make an internal move and ended up accepting a pay cut, despite the new role being the same level and work being substantially more challenging. After 6 months in the role I receive a retention bonus that closed the gap on my salary cut, to be paid out over a year. Fast forward to now, I have an offer from another company that is substantially more than my current salary, but I’d like to give my company an opportunity to counter, without seeming greedy. My primary concern is how to approach this situation and what would be the reasonable ask.

2019: $88k base 2020 (after returning to company): $125k base 

2021 (after internal move): $105k base + $30k retention bonus paid in installments (Jan + July 2022) 2022: $115k base after receiving 10% raise (+$40k in equity over 4 years)

TSA will take your bag aside after check-in, but will typically have you watch as they inspect your bag before sending it on to the airline. However, it will not be opened again until you take possession after baggage claim.

Rasa(meat soup), which is not much thick, Rasala (churned spicy curd), Raga(variety of soft drink prepared with dravyas having sweet, sour and salt tastes), Khandava(special type of soft drinks prepared with dravyas having sweet,sour,salt and astringent taste), Panakam or panchasaram( soft drink prepared with honey, dates, grapes, black currant and sugar) etc. can be prepared with thin slices of banana and jack fruit, stored in brand new clay pot and turned a little sour can be used to drink, served in earthen mug.

1. Save your W2s, all of them, for at least 2 years.

2. Save your paystubs, but not any and all of them. Especially if you get commissions or overtime or bonuses, you will want to save the last paystub of the year that shows all the year-to-date earnings broken down by category. Also the last paystub at an employer. Also if you got an especially big commission/bonus/etc. At least 2 years' worth.

3. If you're self employed or 1099, keep your entire tax return, every single page, every single schedule. For at least 2 years, if not more. Most people will have digital copies but some people never get a digital copy from their accountants and they might have a hard time locating it for you or be ""too busy"" when you need them.

4. If you have any court orders that has to do with marriage/divorce/child support (going in and going out)/judgments/liens/bankruptcies/etc. save them indefinitely. ""Hey, you had this one lien/judgment on your record 10 years ago. Most likely gone now but we still need proof to triple check mmk?"" Is pretty common when you're trying to buy a house. Again. Every single page.

5. If you've owned/sold a home, documents pertaining to the purchase/sale of the home. Most people are good about keeping this but sometimes, if you were on the title for, let's say, your parents' house, and you weren't involved much in the sale, you might not have anything. But if you were on title, that means you might be asked for documentation for one reason or another. Same goes for title transfers like Quit Claim Deeds.

6. Proof of sale for cars, boats, other taxable vehicles. In case the new owner never does the proper paperwork and you end up owing taxes that turn into judgments for something you sold and now need to prove to remove the judgment.

7. Employment contract/offer letter/promotion letter if you change jobs and want to buy before you've established history at that new job. It's a hassle at some employers, to get that stuff again, especially in food service, construction, manufacturing, most blue collar jobs, small businesses etc.

These are all I can think of off the top of my head. Feel free to bring up more in the comments if you have personal experiences.

LifeProTips,/r/LifeProTips/comments/tf4ccw/lpt_take_every_opportunity_you_can_to_speak/,"Until about four years ago, my previous positions were very analytical in nature and were centered around written reports and communication. I rarely had to verbally convey information to large groups.

When I took on a new position, I was required to be a cross-location meeting leader and primary presenter for a group of about 60 attendees. In addition, I was required to lead smaller weekly and bi-weekly calls

At first, this was nerve wracking, given my lack of speaking experience. What made the difference was focusing on the needs of my audience, rather than worrying about what their perception of me as presenter would be:

- Focus on providing a service to your audience, rather than being self focused.

- Know your material inside and out. If you have your material down, and speak to the audience instead of reading, you will already have achieved much of your objective

- Realize the audience isn’t judging you as much as you think. If you are engaging, they will be focused on the content and have questions or want additional information

I wish I had been forced out of my comfort zone earlier in life. The effect that consistent public speaking has had on my confidence can’t be overstated. When you are able to face one of the most intimating social circumstances on regular basis and excel, every day social interactions will not seem intimating.

LifeProTips,/r/LifeProTips/comments/tf1meu/lpt_unless_its_covered_under_warranty_do_not/,"If you are bringing in your car to a dealership for service and repairs chances are you are getting ripped off. This applies primarily to Domestic and Japanese cars in the US. (Ford, Chevy, Toyota, Honda etc.) if you have European car your situation is a little different.

Your typical car dealership is going to charge 5-20% more for labor and parts as opposed to a local mechanic. On top of that they are more than likely to bill you for unnecessary things (although any mechanic will do this) like ""fluid Checks"" and ""tune ups"". These ""checks"" are total BS because you do not need to pay a mechanic to find issues on your car, they will do that for free (and often times its not broken). these are added in to make it seem like they are doing a lot of work and how they can get away with charging you $500 for a service that should really only cost $250. ""tune ups"" on the other hand are them spraying what is essentially a $5 can of sea foam in your air intake and billing you $50 for it. assuming they even do that.

(European car owners this doesn't necessary apply to you) However just because they are a ______ dealer doesn't mean they know how to work on the car better, this comes back to finding a trusted mechanic, If anything a good mechanic is going to do a much better job fixing your car than a dealership would.

The best thing to do is ask around/do a yelp or google search and find a well reviewed mechanic that has a reputation for being honest and doing good work. You want to look for the Jim's auto repair that your friend takes his car too and has 100's of legit positive reviews on google. You do not want to go to one of the large chains (Goodyear, Jiffy Lube, Mr. Tire, etc.) those places are whole different story of don't go.

As well don't be afraid to negotiate or say no. are they saying your brake fluid needs to be changed? probably BS. have you noticed your car is squealing like a banshee when you brake and they say you need new pad and rotors? probably true. a good way to negotiate as well is just to simply ask. They tell you its going to be $1,000 for that repair you need? just ask them what they can do for you on the price, worst they will tell you is no.

Finally, get a basic understanding of what your car needs. do not rely on the person billing you, telling you what needs to be done. your vehicles service intervals will be in your owners manual, refer to that as opposed to the dealership clerk.

If you own a European car, that's a much more difficult situation. Your best bet is to apply the above concepts just in hopes you can find a mechanic that can work on European cars without messing it up.

This was a lot of details but I hope it helps, in short the only work you should have done at a dealer is the work that's covered under warranty.","LPT, Unless it's covered under warranty, DO NOT bring your car to a dealership for service or repairs. Go to a trusted local mechanic."
