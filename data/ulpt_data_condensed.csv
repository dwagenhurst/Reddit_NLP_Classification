UnethicalLifeProTips,/r/UnethicalLifeProTips/comments/u96yd6/ulpt_request_the_job_shouldve_been_mine_4_years/,"I'm an engineer, my first job in the industry was with one of my best friends (let's call him Paul, also an an engineer) and the guy who owned the business (let's call him Steve). Steve gives me a very informal position, pays me like a contractor but insists that I'm a casual. Early on, Steve offers me full time contract position **in writing** once I've graduated university. I graduate university, and 4 months later, still nothing. He doesn't even bring it up unless I say something first.

Sometimes when it was a particularly busy time of year, I worked 70+ hour weeks for Steve, sometimes working until absurd hours of the night; and was still expected to show up for my standard 9 hour day at 8am. And don't get me wrong, I got things wrong sometimes; but I was still in unversity, barely introduced to the industry at this point. 

Other times during the year, when it's a slow month, there isn't enough work coming in for me to get paid ""properly"", so working a 9 hour day got me 30 cents on the dollar I should've earned. More than a few occasions, I earned 10 cents to the dollar. A couple occasions I didn't get paid at all. By the end, a **VERY** conservative estimate puts the total at $18,000 he owes me in unpaid wages.

A month after I graduate, I address it with Steve. He moves the goalposts. I make it to said goalposts roughly 2 months later, but he moves them again. 1 month later I've already started looking for something else, but as I'm driving him to our local airport (so he can go interstate for our work), I tell him: ""*This is causing me a great deal of stress and is making it difficult to feed my wife and myself. If you can't give me a full time contract, just tell me and we can part as friends. Just let me know by the time you get back. Please. Thank you. Have a good trip.*"" I explain my position to Paul, who agrees that it's not okay for Steve to keep doing this to me after I've addressed it with him so many times and especially since he gave me the offer in writing.

I pick Steve up two weeks later from said airport and ask him again. He says: *""I haven't given it any thought yet.""* I simmer in silent rage and drop him home, going into work the next day as usual, but knowing full well I'm abandoning ship the instant I have a chance.

A couple weeks and a few interviews later, I get a new job. Not wanting to be a jerk, I give two weeks notice, despite not needing to and him definitely not deserving it.

At this new job, I start to understand the full extent of Steve taking advantage of me and so I figure out how much he owes me. Lengthly legal discussions proceed and I offer him an ultimatum of taking him to court, or he pay me $15,000 and half my legal fees. Steve eventually pays me.

Following this, Paul drops me like a f\*cking hot potato and he's barely spoken to me since. He, the best man at my wedding, and I, a groomsman at his. Our wives (Kate and Melanie) work together as well and we all would hang as good friends on plenty of occasions before all this. Kate starts treating my wife like the office idiot who microwaves fish for lunch everyday. A decade long friendship with Paul and Kate, gone, like it's nothing. 

Fast forward to today, and Steve is now advertising the position he originally offered me years ago and refused to give me. Paul is still in his exact same position as far as I can tell. I want to apply to it so that I can write a VERY sharply worded cover letter and demand an interview since it's 4 years overdue.

There are several things you can do.

For example, if you're in a building with a single elevator and you want to go down and say check the mail and come back up, you risk some asshole using the right elevator after you, and then have to wait for it again.  Next time, before you get off the elevator, you can buy yourself some extra time by also pressing the buttons for two or three floors below you (or parking levels perhaps). You can get your mail or food delivery or whatever you need, and the elevator will take time and do its thing. By the time you're done, you'll be able to get back on and go back to your floor.

Another example is if you have multiple elevators, and you don't want to wait.  Press both the up and down buttons, and you will be able to get an available elevator faster. Depending on the type of elevator, even if you get one that was going in the wrong direction, most of the time you may be able to redirect this elevator to go where you want it to by letting it close, then pressing the button to open the door, and then selecting whichever floor you intend to go to.

Worst case scenario is sometimes there may be someone already in the elevator that was going in the wrong direction that you tried to hijack. You can just hide or feign ignorance if that happens. Either way, you've lost nothing. You were still going to wait for an elevator anyways, and there was a chance you would have gotten one earlier than anticipated.

My work is intense. I mentioned I was in a car accident and needed x-rays and therefore would need the day. They want more info. Not documentation, but I know they'll look for that seatbelt burn along my neck and the airbag burn on my chest. 

I have a ton of makeup, but am looking for any advice on how to enhance these bruised areas, add setting spray, and keep it believable?

Any pro makeup aficionado tips or tricks?

Simple Explanation: The way this works is that the laser reflects through the glass and as a result, the computer thinks the mouse is moving and cannot get a solid stationary surface reading.

UnethicalLifeProTips,/r/UnethicalLifeProTips/comments/u114z1/ulpt_request_how_to_handle_hypothetical_pet/,"I saw a recent post about pet insurance fraud, and I’m trying to figure out if this HYPOTHETICAL situation qualifies.

I have a 3 year old male cat that has lived a fairly healthy life. I bought pet insurance about 2 months ago, and I have a vet appointment coming up in a week. I recently had a conversation with a neighbor who has cats, and they mentioned that they weren’t able to get insurance to cover urinary issues because their cat had a history of urinary blockages. 

I started looking into my insurance policy, I saw that the insurance wouldn’t cover the cost of preexisting conditions or new conditions related to preexisting ones. I’m completely freaked out because I reported no existing conditions on his insurance application and now realize that an ER visit for urinary issues from 2 years ago may be considered a pre existing condition (we never got a diagnosis). Can someone tell me if I should be worried? How do I fix this? 

Some background:

When the cat was about 1 year old, he had a minor/partial urinary blockage that was treated at an ER vet. It was caught very early on, and they prescribed him some special food as a precaution to keep him clear, and he was on that food for maybe 1 month. We attributed the whole thing to stress because we were moving around a lot back then. Additionally, he hasn’t had any issues since that incident, so I never thought much of it. I didn’t think that emergency visit was indicative of a preexisting condition because we never got a formal diagnosis (according to the internet, pet insurers consider nearly everything to be a preexisting “condition”).

He hasn’t had any health issues since the ER, and we haven’t been back to the vet due to financial hardship. I know this is controversial and I’m not proud of this. I’ve worked extremely hard to get out of that hole and I’m finally in a better financial situation. I decided to get him insured and take him in for a full work-up. I got insurance about 2 months ago, and my appointment is coming up this week, but now I’m wondering if I made a huge mistake when applying for pet insurance because I didn’t mark off that he had any preexisting conditions. 

I got his old medical records transferred, but these are super outdated (pre ER visit). I’m anticipating that he’ll need quite a bit of vaccine updates among other things. I don’t think the ER visit is included on this record because I haven’t been to a vet since then. I want to ask my current vet about the medical record, but what could I even do if I don’t see that ER visit listed? 

I figured the insurance company would have access to a database that would show a history of an ER visit and prescription food, so if it was in fact a pre existing condition, wouldn’t they have mentioned this and denied my application? 

How do I fix this without getting myself in major trouble? Could I just pay up front for future treatments that are related to his urinary health to avoid any issues with insurance?

UnethicalLifeProTips,/r/UnethicalLifeProTips/comments/u061rq/ulpt_if_you_are_a_man_over_40_and_want_to_make_a/,"In March 2007, 17-year-old high school senior Chelsea Doss (now Chelsea Brooke Rose), [traveled](http://eaglevilletnhistory.com/print/Apr_2007_P2.pdf) four hours from Eagleville to Gatlinburg, Tennessee, to participate in the state’s 79th annual Future Farmers of America convention.  

Among the convention attendees was her future husband, the then vice chairman of the board of the Tennessee FFA and current Tennessee congressman John Rose.

Not even four years later, according to an engagement announcement in the now-defunct local paper the *Eagleville Times*, the two were married. Chelsea was at the time a 21-year-old college senior at Tennessee Technical University; John was a 45-year-old software executive with a long history of involvement in the Tennessee FFA, a board member of both the FFA and chairman of the board at Chelsea’s college.

The *Eagleville Times* reported that Chelsea has a birthday in August, and Tennessee voter files have an entry for her married name with a birth year of 1989—which was one year after Rose, who was born in February 1965, [graduated](https://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/2018/10/10/meet-john-rose-candidate-u-s-congress-district-6/1582211002/) from Tennessee Technical University. The *Times* also [reported](http://eaglevilletnhistory.com/print/Feb_2008_P1.pdf) that Chelsea had a meeting with then–Tennessee Gov. Phil Bredesen in January 2008, where Rose was present. She would have been an 18-year-old college freshman at the time, while he was 42.

They possibly met even earlier. A Tennessee Future Farmers of America [press release from 2014](https://www.nasda.org/news/tennessee-chelsea-rose-named-executive-director-of-tn-ffa) notes that Doss “began her involvement with FFA in 2003,” as a high school freshman. Eagleville’s FFA chapter was a formidable one, named Overall Mid-state District Champions at the state FFA convention all four years that Chelsea was involved (and 17 straight years preceding that).

Not long after her triumph at the 2007 FFA convention, Doss received the Jerry and Betty Williams Rose Scholarship, named after Rose’s parents, to attend Tennessee Tech after graduating high school. She was very grateful for that support in a [2010 interview with the *Murfreesboro Post*](https://www.murfreesboropost.com/community/christianas-doss-to-meet-education-secretary/article_d0e166db-30fe-57f6-8b9d-4d5a10440472.html), from before the two were married.

“John has made everything possible that I’ve done in FFA beyond high school. Through the scholarship that he provides, I’ve not had to have a job through college,” Chelsea said, indicating that the scholarship was secured before she arrived on campus as a freshman. “I’ve been able to train, improve, focus on FFA and focus on school. That scholarship has made all the difference,” she continued. “\[John\] has also coached me during my preparation, which has been extremely helpful.”

Chelsea wouldn’t turn 18 until August of her freshman year. At the same time, Rose was also sitting on the board of Tennessee Technical University. He was named chairman of the Board of Directors in April 2007, one month after the 2007 Tennessee FFA convention, and served in that role throughout the entirety of Chelsea’s time at TTU, including at the time of their 2011 marriage. Rep. Rose’s office didn’t respond to questions about the congressman’s role in awarding Chelsea the Rose family scholarship.

So the husband and I just moved to a new house. His dad is very uninvolved in our lives, we hear from him maybe twice a year and see him even less often than that. He is also a known criminal &amp; conman, has stolen
identities, taken money from my sister in law, and been to prison for something along the lines of embezzlement. Among many other things I’m sure. 

So after we moved, he was very insistent upon coming to see us and see our new house. Plans for him to come over didn't work out the first time and he was adamant
about rescheduling and making it happen. I was suspicious of why he all of a sudden cared so much to see us but thought maybe he just wanted to see whether our new house was nicer than his house.

He came over probably about three weeks ago and yesterday we got what looks like one of those pieces of mail with a bunch of coupons to places like lowes, bed bath and beyond, etc that you get when you move. It
was addressed to my father in law at our address.

One day the principal saw them holding hands. He went and told one of the teachers that if he ever finds out that they were alone together he'll have them arrested and make their parents pick them up from the police station. 
Where does racism come into play?
There are many other couples that do far worse than holding hands. We have a pair that make out in the lunch room daily, another that are constantly hugging by the vending machines, and many more who just regularly hug and hold hands in the hall. The difference between my friends and all the other couples? They're interracial. 

This isn't the first time our school has had similar discrimination problems. Just yesterday a white kid beat a mixed Mexican kid up so much that he was bleeding, and he only got 5 days of suspension. A month or two before a Mexican kid told a white kid that she needed to stop telling people that he shoved her into a locker. (He wasn't even at school at the time she claimed it happened.) And cussed her out. He was told that if he came back to school he would be expelled. 

Last year someone brought an airsoft gun to school and colored in the orange part, and continously pointed it at a gay kid and and said that he was going to shoot him, ""because he was a f**.""

Customers were in a hurry, and the ones who tipped would drop their coin change into the basket. Most of the time, bills went back into a wallet or purse, and coins went into the jar.

The tip: **Dollar coins.** Nobody really pays attention to or uses dollar coins in America, so what I would do is give them as change and people would drop them into the basket without counting or looking.

For example, a customer's total comes out to $6.35 and they pay with a $20. You owe them $13.65 in change.

Take a $10 bill, **TWO** $1 bills, a dollar coin, and a $0.65 in regular change from the register.

Then it's all about the way you describe handing them the change. Hand them the cash as if it was 13, and the change as if it was 65.

Here's how it goes:

""Alright, thanks so much you change is thirteen \**hand them 12 in cash, with the ones on the bottom\** sixty five \**drop 1.65 in their hand in change\*.* Have a great day!"" Best strategy is to be friendly and engaged with the customer but also seem slightly side tracked and busy.

The plan was to pick up my cat after all my stuff was in the new place - I thought this would be the least-stressful option for her since she wouldn't need to be around any loud noises, or go through multiple car/van/truck rides. 

My (now former) acquaintance agreed to watch her knowing that it would take a bit of time, and said he would notify me if it became an issue so we could ask someone else to watch her. I offered to pay for everything, and even drop off physical products like food/water/etc. which he refused. He insisted that I not worry and that everything would be taken care of, because he understood how dire my situation was and I didn't have other good options at the time. I have all of these conversations documented with proof and photos, and I'm glad I did because I should not have trusted this person.

Long story short, he claimed I ""abandoned"" my cat and that I told him I didn't want her anymore, refused to provide for her, and never spoke to him again after I dropped her off.

UnethicalLifeProTips,/r/UnethicalLifeProTips/comments/tw5yan/ulpt_conquer_a_family_restaurant/,"""Camilion branding"" a restaurant chain that has no brand of its own but adopts the local known ""homey"" joint brand(legally), then drives prices down to bankrupt the original, then completely absorb any asset the original had for profit.

Here how it's work in my head.

&amp;#x200B;

Pre-step: a scout goes thru an area looking for a cute place to hang out in, casually interviews the locals for places with a nice atmosphere.

&amp;#x200B;

step 0#: said scout evaluates target store for certain characteristics:

&amp;#x200B;

\-one or more staple products that

&amp;#x200B;

have local recognisability with the positive sentiment (""Papa Alex chilli fries are a fucking legend"")

&amp;#x200B;

easy to reproduce with cheaper alternatives or existing within the chain production process(frozen fries instead of fresh, chilli from a can etc'...)

&amp;#x200B;

\-character worker who has a personal relationship with the community. To be targeted as an asset for the ""acquisition"" step later primarily if he is irreplaceable for the brand feel. If one of the targeted workers is the owner himself or family favour the ""buy and squeeze"" option later

&amp;#x200B;

\-identify successful key brand schematics if there are, colour logo plating decor... then inquire whatever they filled a trademark claim. \[if not rush the steps to the opening step and recommend filling for trademark ASAP. If a trademark is in place go for the borderline copy even if the originals will file a claim for TM infringement the chain will stand to lose much less than the owner as legal procedures are more expensive for small businesses.\]

&amp;#x200B;

\-identify buyable location near the original for the ""compete and squeeze"" option later

&amp;#x200B;

\-inquire for owner business model as to exploit flaws that will improve leverage during the ""buy and squeeze"" option later, which includes overpaid staff, quality products with alternatives, underpriced bonus food and drinks (free refills, employe that give a couple of fries for free with a wink).

&amp;#x200B;

\-find out if the owners have savings it will make easier to predict how long the original will survive if competed against

&amp;#x200B;

\-finally, recommend for the opening team the scouts insight on whether to ""compete and squeeze"" or ""buy and squeeze"".

&amp;#x200B;

If chosen option failed the default option of ""compete and sabotage "" will be enacted.

&amp;#x200B;

step 1#:

&amp;#x200B;

If B&amp;S chosen.

&amp;#x200B;

evaluate primary acquiring costs

&amp;#x200B;

approach owners with an extremely undervalued offer for the place; if accepted(unlikely) stonks

&amp;#x200B;

if not, it's still part of the plan. come with a new offer this time with the owner and targeted workers as managers or elevated shift managers while keeping their salaries and promise to keep the brand of the place without change. \*\*with some legal loophole allowing for cuts\*\*, barter for at least \~70% ownership buy to ensure the changes to come.

&amp;#x200B;

start to implement the cutting steps made by the scout and planning team replace products, cut salaries etc'

&amp;#x200B;

squeeze the owners. Keep, give raise, and promote targeted employees so he won't leave after we basically destroyed his home from the inside.

&amp;#x200B;

If C&amp;S chosen

&amp;#x200B;

amazon the original till he cries Jeff's jizz, use mentioned capital evaluation to accurately predict when the bankruptcy begins.

&amp;#x200B;

replicate products and brand as planned

&amp;#x200B;

initial boost to wages and lower prices of dishes at a loss that a large chain can afford, unlike the local business who most likely has a small margin of profit and small capital liquidity ;););)

&amp;#x200B;

send scouts for signs of defeat, disgruntled owner, unclean tables food quality goes down. Accelerate steps to ensure there is no ""brand kamikaze""

&amp;#x200B;

privately send tempting offers for targeted employees

&amp;#x200B;

Slap suit the owner just to rub it in if the trademark case was successful.

&amp;#x200B;

after bankruptcy raise prices again do the cutting steps mentioned above.

&amp;#x200B;

step 2# and final:

&amp;#x200B;

formalise a business plan test it for a few months then show promising sell the venture to a new franchised model and bounce the scout to a new location.

&amp;#x200B;

""compete and sabotage"" is exactly what it sounds like. Go wild if casual competition does not work.

In 2021 I sold our house and bought a new house in a different city. In our old city where our kids went to school there was a designated line for parents to wait in their cars to pick up their children after school. These were the rules of the line: 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Pull as far forward as you can (within reason)
2. When you pick up your child(ren) pull out of the line.
3. When the car in front of you pulls out, you move up to take their place.
4. No cutting in line.
5. No picking up children in the travel lane.
6. No children walking through the parking lot unaccompanied by an adult.
7. If you want to pick up your child and not wait in the line, you can park in the parking lot, and walk to the sidewalk to escort your child back to your car. 

They even had faculty members walking along the sidewalk enforcing these rules. it was a good system and make child pickup quick and efficient. 

This year (because of COVID, I guess?) the new school is not operating any busses for student transport, so there are more parents picking up students than normal. As a result the pickup line can get really long. (\~250 meters from beginning to end, I measured)

We assumed that when we moved into a newer neighborhood with a newer school, that there would be a similar system in place. But no, there is no system like that. Normally this would be fine, if everyone in the world  were considerate, unselfish, and actually had two brain cells to rub together. 90% of the parents do a great job. They arrive early if they want to be near the front, and get in the back of the line if they arrive late -- makes complete sense. 

However, there are a few parents that arrive only a minute or two before school gets out that drive past all of the parents waiting in line and pull into the parking lot. They wait for a parent to pull out and then quickly zip into the vacated spot, cutting off the cars behind and preventing the line from moving forward. 

I'm getting real fed up with these Karens thinking the (unspoken rules of how lines work) don't apply to them. I've tried some mature solutions, some immature solutions, and some rude solutions, but nothing seems to have any effect. Here are some things I have done, ordered from most mature, to least mature. 

1. Parked in the parking lot, approached cutters on foot, and asked them to respect the line like the rest of the parents. (brushed off and ignored)
2. Contacted the principal (father of a friend of mine), voiced my concerns, and he said that he agreed with my concerns and would send out an email outlining proper procedure. (weeks ago, no email sent yet)
3. For several days I pulled in front of the cutters into a bottle-neck and waited there until all cars in the line had picked up their children. (after a few days of this, they learned to wait in line like the rest of us, but then went back to it after I didn't park in the bottle neck for a few days. 
4. Parked my car in the bottle-neck, got out, and waited on the sidewalk to pick up my daughter. (Principal approached me and ask me not to leave my car parked there)

UnethicalLifeProTips,/r/UnethicalLifeProTips/comments/ttolig/ulpt_you_can_save_tens_of_thousand_of_dollars_on/,"Over the course of my education I have saved roughly 100k on school using this trick, despite my family being well off.  Every year before I fill out Fafsa on October 1st(you get more aid the earlier you apply), my parents and I move as many of our assets to my grandparents accounts as possible.  They drain their bank accounts and make all their big purchases for the year in late September.  It should be noted that most questions on the FAFSA ask about your assets on **the day you are filling out the fafsa**, so you can transfer the money right back the day after(I would wait a month just in case though).  I move most of the money I have made throughout the year to a Roth IRA since Fafsa does not consider it when determining your aid.  This trick alone has saved some of my friends 50k+.  

&amp;#x200B;

The financial aid potential gets even larger if your parents are divorced.  **You only have to report the financial information of one of your parents on the Fafsa if your parents are divorced.**  The craziest part is, it doesn't matter who claimed you as a dependent, doesn't matter if one if your parents pays for everything, doesn't matter if one of your parents hasn't talked to you in years, YOU PICK who you report.  I have never seen anything like it before but they tell you to chose the parent that you stay with the most, despite this information not being remotely verifiable.  This is what bumped me up to the next level in terms of financial aid.  My dad pays for most things because he makes hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, but that doesn't matter.  All fafsa sees is my mom making an average income trying to support two kids on her own.

&amp;#x200B;

**Legality of this ULPT:**

Most people, including myself, would say that this is textbook fraud after hearing about it for the first time.  However, we have spoken to multiple finance specializing lawyers and accountants about whether or not this is allowed.

UnethicalLifeProTips,/r/UnethicalLifeProTips/comments/tqbq1q/ulpt_request_how_to_mess_up_my_rented_room_before/,"I’ve been living in a small rented room. It’s called a “kosan” in Bahasa Indonesia (like a studio apartment, but much much smaller)

Anyway, the service provider, Mr X, rented this building from Ms. Y, who lives oversea.

Mr.X then rent the rooms to other people, including me.

Mr. X employed this guy that I’ll call LazyFuck, whose responsibility was to overlook the renters’ needs.

Me and LazyFuck were never in a good term. This is an old building so there were lots of damages, like leaking, molds, broken water heater, intermittent internet connection, etc. I used to complain a lot, demanding fixes. But LazyFuck never bother with my requests. 

I, therefore, complained to Mr.X, who, instead of firing LazyFuck’s ass, told me to “not bother LazyFuck anymore”, and that I need to voice my complains to him (Mr.X) directly instead. So I did.

Mr. X was a good landlord (I don’t know if that’s the right term because he doesn’t own the building, but he has the right to rent the rooms to people). He fixed my problems with the room. All was good. 

Cut to several months later.

Last week, the internet connection was suddenly very slow. I checked the router near my room, it had been replaced somehow. I asked Mr. X what was up? His answer was:

“This ‘kosan’ isn’t handled by me anymore. LazyFuck had manipulated Ms.Y to not renting her building to me anymore, and now Ms.Y will rent the kosan directly, with LazyFuck as her right hand”

Apparently LazyFuck had told Ms.Y how profitable this whole kosan business is, and that she should rent the rooms directly to customers instead of renting the whole building to Mr.X. So she broke the contract with Mr.X.

Now, with Mr.X gone, and Ms.Y uncontactable by me, the only person I can talk about the rent is LazyFuck. The thing is, he’s been ignoring my messages and calls. He had this Whatsapp group where he would make announcements and everything to most tenants, but he didn’t invite me along with several other tenants. It seems like he wanted us gone. But he never told me anything, he just ignored me completely.

I had no choice but to go from here when my rent is up. Luckily I have some emergency money from my shitcoin investment last year, so I was able to find a better place in a couple of days.

Now, I need some help. I wanna mess with this room. But it needed to be subtle that it could be seen as “natural damage” and that “it wasn’t reported earlier because LazyFuck never bother to answer my call”

Example I could think of:

- poke some holes on the long flexible pipe leading to the shower head thingy (dunno what’s called)
- turning on the AC, then open up the remote case and mess with its PCB, put the case back in, so they need to find an alternative remote to turn the AC off (I’m also thinking of opening up the window so it would make the AC working extra for several days
- I don’t know what else


Their things that exist in my room:
- TV
- wardrobe
- work table
- bed side table
- bed (this is already in a bad condition because my cat used to scratch on it all the time, but I was planning to pay for it using my deposit, which I won’t bother try to get back, it’s not that much of money anyway)
- cupboard
- sink
- bathtub

- also I have login access to their router

In Ontario when you get a traffic ticket it stays on your record for three years. I’ve had many tickets over the years, and realized I can reduce the increased insurance rates to only 2 years, potentially saving hundreds if not thousands of dollars. Tickets show up on you abstract once you pay your fine. Insurance generally checks your abstract about a month prior to renewal, so this leaves you a one month period where you can pay your ticket without it effecting your rates for that year. You will still have to pay for the next 2 years, but it definitely helps. Just renewed your insurance? No problem. Wait until the final day to choose to fight the ticket in court, now wait until the court day is close and reschedule. This should put the date 6-8 months away from the offence date. Finally, show up to court, make a deal with the prosecutor (if possible), plead guilty and request an additional 4-6 months to pay the fine (money is tight). This should allow for that ideal period to pay the fine.  Hope this helps someone",ULPT: Reducing cost of traffic tickets

Its an IT-related company, in a country in Southwestern Europe. I currently live in that country. The resume which I used for getting this job, contains fake work experiences. In those fake experiences, the company names are real, but I never worked in any of those. The IT company already has sent me the joining date and everything, but the work contract will be sent to me after couple of days (on the day of start).

The company asked for some documents such as- ID, degree certificates, ..., and **proof of work experience: pay slips or reference letters (up to previous three years)** and so on. Even if I cannot give them all of these at the moment, the remaining documents will be asked for during the first days of joining the company.

During the last 3 years, only one experience (out of 4) is mentioned. That job (fake) has the end date as October 2019. So, till now, around '*2 years 4 months'* have been passed. As I mentioned earlier, all of the experiences are fake, but the company names used there are real. I am very worried. Obviously, I don't have any true reference letter or pay slips to give. The job is very important for me. What can I do?

The companies which I mentioned in the CV are from a different country. Can I just say to them that I don't have any documents from those companies with me? or should I produce fake reference letter or pay slip (using software or something)? I really want this job, it's tremendously important for my living and I really want to continue working in this company without being caught in the future.

What can I do to save myself from being caught by the company? Please give me some solutions.","I used fake work experience and got a job, haven't started the job yet. The company is asking for reference from previous employers. What should I do?"

UnethicalLifeProTips,/r/UnethicalLifeProTips/comments/tmttil/ulpt_if_you_have_at_least_5_years_job_experience/,"i used to be a employee and well its  was as it sounds show up for work, do your work 8 to 5, contribute to your 401k or other bs plan, accept 1 to 2% raises and year and seem grateful for it.

a couple years ago while working in IT, i started befriending one of the contractors working there i was making 35/hr and asked him how much he was billing... 150/hr to do pretty much the same job. ya i was shocked better still since i was salary when they had those bs 5pm meetings where i would stay till 6pm too seem like a team player (no overtime), he was either not included got to go home or billing 225/hr to just sit there.

so i did the same thing as him, opened a company in my name for 70$, applied as a contractor to multiple different positions, got hired pretty fast at 50/hr + tax so nearly 60/hr. i got the same treatment as if i was hired as a employee, my fellow employees only know im not full time if they ask if not they assume im like them.

difference is i get my whole paycheck, which i can invest over the year and make money on my money, come tax season i get to deduct pretty much anything IT related, car, food, phone, internet, part of rent, gaming pc, monitors ect its all for my company right? 

so in the end i make money on my income that i only owe at the end of the year yes, i get to allocate as much as i want to investments without using 401k ( i know there's benefits but you can get rug pulled pretty bad), i deduct so much i actually pay less taxes than as an employee. also at work i have a lot more rights, my contract says 7.5 hrs a day, want me to stay longer, better put that in writing and pay time and a half if not im going home.

 company forces employees to wear some ridiculous uniform nope, im gonna come in in jeans and t shirt, as im not an employee. boss wants to argue and have a shouting match, be carful mr boss man i could just get up and leave i owe you nothing, then again i can bill you to argue with me if you want. also as the company doesn't have to pay extra benefits i can ask for higher raises each year as it over costs them less to keep billing to me.

job safety is actually better, usually its a 6 month to 1 year contract, and yes they can terminate when they want but, usually if you are good at what you do they just reknew, and oh 1 month before renewing you can go talk to recruiters see if you can change company and make even more or stay there and match other companies offers. as an employee i've been let go randomly as a contractor even if it was not working out its easier for them to just keep you till the end of your contract, so you can spend the last months looking for another job. 

anyways if you think you have more job safety as an employee, forget that become a contractor and get paid more, pay less taxes and get better raises.","ULPT: if you have at least 5 years job experience, become a contractor to pay less taxes"

By law, they have to cease attempts to collect the debt for 30 days until they can provide you with proof. After 30 days, if they haven’t responded, the debt is considered invalid (you would then just have to let the credit bureaus know the debt is not valid).

I have read/heard that often when creditors sell your debt to the collection agency, they don’t provide all the information that they would be required to provide to you within 30 days, so when the collection agency gets these letters they often just write off the debt as a loss. Of course, I’m sure this depends on the original creditor and the collection agency and the amount of the debt with regard to whether they consider it “worth it” to reply with the required proof within 30 days.

I've been able to get in contact with someone who can prescribe meds - again, this provider has a loose affiliation w/my university and is quite cheap (not free tho). 

The big question - how can I hide meds? I've put forth a few ideas below and my thoughts about them, but I'd like to see if y'all can come up with something better, please 🥺

\-----------------------------

* rent a locker at university, and put meds in there. 
   * Pros - very safe, I have access to the only key and I can just take 'em as needed. 
   * Cons - Idk what I'll do during summer/winter/spring/thanksgiving break.
* leave my meds in an obscure (indoor) spot @ the campus
   * Pros - if it's obscure enough, only I will know where that spot is. Don't need to splurge for a locker. 
   * Cons - Might be illegal since someone might find it / eat it (it's a controlled substance probably)? Might get stolen. I might forget where said spot it. It might be thrown away by cleaning staff. bad idea probably. 
* put the meds in my backpack.
   * Pros - I don't need to worry about timing. I have it with me all the time. 
   * Cons - My mom always thinks my backpack is too heavy for my back and wants to see what's in it. Usually it's just a laptop/ipad/charger stuff but if they see the meds I'm toast. Also, the meds might make a ""clinking"" sound as I walk which will definitely give them away.
* Hide it in another medication bottle at home.
   * Pros - I have it with me all the time. My parents aren't *looking* for it / aren't suspicious of anything so it might just skip their notice. 
   * Cons - I read about this in a TIFU post so it might not be a good idea lol (OP there had their parent accidentally take too much ADHD meds instead of zinc or whatever). 

As y'all can see, my ideas seem to get progressively worse, so any help would be appreciated, tysm!",ULPT Request: Need help hiding (prescribed!) prescription medication from my parents

I am providing some backstory if you are interested. 

Basically, it was very nice out yesterday for the first time in a while so my girlfriend and I decided to go for a walk in a nice park. We end up taking the long way back to our car to head home and while on the way back a dog ran up to us barking ( white pit Bull) , at first it’s stance was very aggressive so we figured that it had intentions of hurting us. I sat down to get on its level so the dog wasn’t intimated by me and let it sniff me and all. After a few minutes it calmed down and let me pet it and started licking my face. We walked around with the dog asking people nearby if they saw anything or knew anything. Nobody had seen / heard anything. At this point , neither of us had been in this situation before so we didn’t know what to do. The dog sat calmly with us and we decided to call around to shelters nearby to see if they take in lost dogs. ( we didn’t want to leave this dog by itself because it just felt like the wrong thing to do, also it was getting dark out at this point, and I forgot to mention that we did run into one guy who told us that people take the tags off their dogs, and leave their dogs here ALL THE TIME). This sweet thing just wanted some love. So anyways, after exhausting through a few numbers with no help we look up animal control. We both were unsure if they deal with these things so we decided it’s worth a shot. Someone FINALLY picks up after calling so many numbers and I politely explain to the guy my situation and he aggressively says “ we don’t deal with dogs” and I asked if there was anything I could do/ does he know of any other recourses. He hung up. This really rubbed me the wrong way because this is a panicky situation and we really felt like we were doing the right thing for this poor animal and just wanted to help and this man couldn’t give two shits. Their company say “ wildlife” in their title but it’s not very specific because they have pictures of dogs on their page, have dogs on their van, and what you search up “ what to do with lost dog near me, this is one of the first results”. We ended up finding a place for the dog ( which also looked like it had an infection because it’s hole genital region was swollen red) for the time being and the people their were very sweet. After that was settled I decided to leave a review. And said this 

“I am leaving a review regarding a phone call placed around 6pm. I completely understand that you guys do not deal with lost dogs. Most of your guys replies to other comments mention that you “ tried to explain it” … but that is not the case. Man who answered the phone was very rude about it. I assume that typically when people find lost dogs they panic and want to get help immediately. When you search “ what to do with lost dog near me” your guys company is one of the first search results. Yes, it clearly states wildlife in title but I would maybe change around that to the first word and make it more clear to people if you care that much and are not going to show any empathy. Very poor business model. If you want people to actually call you guys for help I WOULD SUGGEST being more empathic to the situation and providing the potential future customer with an alternate option. Instead when I called they just hung up. I get it you probably get that question a lot but if you TOOK UR TIME to help I’m more then sure someone would be glad to call when they have a wildlife problem in the future. You guys are really ruining future customers for yourselves one call at a time. I hope you take this review and do something positive with it. Also , for whoever reading this I urge you not to reply saying that’s not the case like in many other replies. You know that’s not true. I truly wish you the best and hope you guys turn this company around .”

“ I really appreciate the review, anything makes us go up on the search list so thanks again” .

I say “I want to go to bed” and move, he says “you don’t actually want to go to sleep, that’s not actually what you want,” insinuating that we will have sex. I say “no I want to go to sleep,” we cuddle some more, then I wake up to him humping me from behind. He gets up to go to the bathroom to clean himself up (I could also smell it).

It is all just computer work, and does not matter if I am sitting at my own computer or on their low spec office computer. However, like many companies, this one wants to transition to be in the office on certain days for no good reason at all.

I have fought against it with every excuse and logic I can find, but they won't budge.  

I was brainstorming whether it might be possible to get a doctors note that would force them to allow me to work from home.  For example being in the office during a deadly pandemic is causing me too much anxiety, or something else.

Have you ever tried to get your point across only to be ignored by people and the one dominating the conversation just going along with his/her talk when in a group? 

It's utterly disrespectful and we all know it makes us feel like shit. But i am going to share a way to make you successfully cut off the conversation and give you a chance to take on.


Put simply, when you want to cut off just give a strong look into the eyes of the guy speaking and put your dominant hand's palm forward at your chest level into the middle of the group, usually people stand in circles, and as you do that, speak in a confident tone of voice when getting your point across.

When you look the guy in the eye with confidence it 's very dominating and they submissively stop and look at you. When they look at you, instinctively others listening to the guy will look at you as well  The palms help you in reinforcing your position ensuring no one else cuts you off. 

Just make sure you don't give an aggressive look, this just makes you seem arrogant. So just give a relaxed but at the same time confident gaze at the guy dominating the conversation.

As soon as you have everyone's attention, look at everyone while speaking confidently to get your point across and to non-verbally show you're the one they should listen to now.",ULPT how to successfully take hold of a group conversation when someone else is dominating the conversation?

want to impress someone on a date? buy an expensive watch, purse, etc, and send it right back. 

need garden tools, a car battery charger, a tire pump, or something else for just one specific use? buy it, send it back the next day.

i've been doing this for years and years. amazon doesn't question anything. they take all returns. just make sure the listing says ""free returns"". no questions asked!

i've probably done this at least 60-70 times over the past 2-3 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

you can also get tons of free stuff like toiletries and clothing. 

bought a few bottles of shampoo? pour a little into the bag and snap a pic, and say ""it leaked all over everything"". they'll usually send a free replacement, or give you a full refund. free stuff.

you can't do this every time, so make it count. 

purchase 12 bottles at once, pour out one bottle into another container, then pop a hole in it and take a picture, then say ""a couple of the bottles exploded!! &gt;.&lt; ""  the angrier you are, the more helpful customer service is. just don't insult the agent personally. 

&amp;#x200B;

i lie constantly about things breaking. 

last week i bought a $90 gaming headset and complained that it wasn't functioning correctly. i've purchased and returned the same item twice now, citing ""defective"" for the reason both times. 

and this time i said ""i'm getting VERY VERY upset that amazon keeps sending me BROKEN STUFF!!"". 

the agent said ""we're sorry, just keep the headset and we'll give you a full refund."" boom, totally free $90 gaming headset. 

i did the same thing with my $100 keyboard, my gaming mouse, and a bunch of other electronics too. 

keep persisting. get mad, but don't act like a nutcase. if worst comes to worst and they won't refund it and let you keep the item, just say ""ok i'll send it back"" and don't. 

it isn't 100% of the time, but it's pretty damn often.

&amp;#x200B;

with clothing, you can snap a pic of the shoulder or hem and easily add a little ""hole"" in the picture. just make sure you resize it so the picture isn't huge, so customer service can't zoom in that much. 

sometimes they'll offer a replacement, in which case you can't do anything about it.

other times--usually when it's fulfilled by Amazon--they'll ask if you want a full refund or a replacement. take the full refund and boom--free clothing.

Following this, we turned ourselves in to our Principle after word of our identities got around. As punishment, he assigned us the task of sorting through several bags of moulding, disgusting trash and recycling. 

This stuff was next level disgusting. There were dense cubes of mould growing inside of bottles and cups, mist and spores of some kind rising from the bags as we sorted, and possibly a couple condoms. (I pray they had not been used)

He was a couple decades older than her (just for context). They divorced as it turned out he had another family somewhere. He also made a lot more money. So when that relationship ended it left my mother in a very difficult position to sustain on her own. A few years later he died. Didn't leave her with anything. But I come to you all because turns out my mother (now 62) can claim his social security as a widow for the rest of her life at 66 but was eligible for taking it earlier if her income is low enough. Her job now pays her around 50k a year with benefits (med, dental, 401k) and the limit to take the social security is around 20K. The social security she would receive would be lessened by the amount she makes over 20k. So she basically receives not only a partial amount and even more stupidly this amount is spread across several months within the same year.

The dilemma: She could work less, have more free time for a paid hobby like selling shit on ebay for cash and get paid the same but loses out on benefits. I can't imagine being 62 living in a world without benefits.

My ask: How can she still work her job with benefits but pocket the social security at the same time? Is there a way for me to employ my mother and give her a low wage? Or have my mom become a business and sell services to her company? I bet she would lose on her benefits. Just trying to brainstorm ways to help my mom set up for a good retirement.

UnethicalLifeProTips,/r/UnethicalLifeProTips/comments/tat9mk/ulpt_how_to_avoid_getting_drafted_before_the/,"As a disclaimer, I am Canadian and I can't speak for how this would work for every military in the world.

This might seem a little bit counterintuitive, but bear with me. The first step is to apply to join the military. Army, navy, air force, it shouldn't really matter. 

Part of the recruitment process, at least in Canada, is a fitness exam, an aptitude test, and a medical exam. You want to pass the fitness and aptitude test, but fail the medical exam. Here's how.

Part of the medical exam will likely involve a questionnaire of you history with drugs and alcohol. On that part of the exam, you want to indicate that you have a drug or alcohol problem. For example, you might indicate that you have been drinking for the last X number of years, that you drink regularly, that in the past you've had blackouts from drinking, that drinking has affected your job performance, and other symptoms of being an alcoholic. Throw in a couple of other drugs too, maybe coke or opioids occasionally.

If the results of your medical exam reveal that you have a drug/alcohol problem, you will be deemed medically unfit for service. AFAIK, the military is not going to draft someone they already deemed medically unfit. They may however, lower this standard if things got bad enough they needed a draft, and look the other way on a conscriptee who is otherwise a capable fighter. And if they do, well we're probably all fucked anyway.

UnethicalLifeProTips,/r/UnethicalLifeProTips/comments/t8vpbd/ulpt_have_friends_register_their_address_to/,"Basically, you need a ""storefront"" to be able to have a google ""my business"" page.

This is like a new thing that happened I think 8 years ago. So the businesses that you can search out through maps, they registered through google.

Here in the US, google will send you a postcard themselves. You have to use that code to verify your google my business account. Afterward, your business will show up in google maps. The more reviews you get on that google business, the more exposed it gets like if you zoom out on that zone or zip code your business will show up more.

Sometimes they will ask if it's actually a storefront, meaning an actual store in a commercial zone. But most of the time, if you pick your category carefully (the ones that can be mobile) they'll let you register it. You can also change the name and business type to whatever you want after it's verified, their system will usually allow it.

So you can get your cousin who lives in that expensive apartment in the city to register for you. You can register from the place you live too, you can have your friend register if she lives in another place. You can encircle an area where you can get better chances of getting leads.

This is a bit spammy, and they might flag you but it's really a grey area because if you're actually a ""mobile"" business, you can say that you go to your friend in the city to conduct business there. Only do this in separate IP and laptops unless if you have a VPN. Because if you're not careful, manual verifiers from their India headquarter will ask you to send a picture of the storefront.

The reason why this works is because a lot of people use mobile and mobile maps to look for a business. Google my business will show the businesses that are closer to them. If you can encircle an area where you want to do the majority of your business, this can work. They'll just tap on the google map storefront and then call you. Make sure you leave your number and even a non paid google forms can work for your leads to leave their info on.

Yes you can have the same website for most storefronts you make. Just be careful with this though, although places like walmart actually do this, people could still flag you.

I'm only sharing this because a lot of big businesses have the money to just throw it to google ads. If you search out lets say detroit barbershop, you'd see the first page that has links backed by Ads and they take up the majority of the first google search page. So how would even a small business survive this??

Google my business is your friend here. Next step is to ask your customers to leave google reviews. You can do this yourself but it's a lot more tedious and takes a long time as google requires different gmails to leave a review.

For those who are going to say that actual reviewers or google reviewers will spot and can report these storefronts as duplicates. Well not if you're careful, and walmart already has something exactly like this. Walmart in detroit google business, walmart in toledo google business etc. Also if you're small enough and you get 100% of your customers from there, no ones gonna be a bum who'd seek out and report your other storefronts.

This is just one of those free methods. You'd get a new funnel for leads, they'd be mobile users for sure but you also can't get to top 1 google search ranking as it takes time. This method is just a free way, takes time though.

UnethicalLifeProTips,/r/UnethicalLifeProTips/comments/t6j7p8/ulpt_request_how_to_get_away_with_being_slightly/,"TL;DR - Rented on Vacasa. The occupancy limit (10) for some reason doesn't match the advertised and pictured bed space (13) and we didn't realize it until after paying. Customer support says ""No exceptions"".

I rented a NC beach house that sleeps 13 people (per the beds listed - 1K, 2Q, 6T, 1F) from Vacasa. It's a very average beach house in an average NC beach house community. The issued stemmed from the fact that you search Vacasa by number of bedrooms, yet the contracts come with a max occupancy, which usually matches bed space, but for this house does not. I didn't really think much of occupancy until I read the contract which is phrased as basically no more than 10 people can even be on the property at once (despite it being a large house, with bed space for 13) and by that time I'd already paid $2k of $6k total. We have 9 adults and 4 kids (over 2yo so they count) so we're 3 over. A full refund is no longer possible, and by now there are essentially zero beach homes for rent in this area of NC, so switching rentals is not possible.

In the end, I'm 90% certain that we will have no issues. There are far too many NC beach houses for rental companies to physically count occupants, and it's not as if we're throwing a party. It's a family beach week, and no one is sleeping on the floor. So the risk is low, but the consequences are high because technically it is a clear violation of the contract. If, for some reason, they did come by and see that we had 3 extra adults, what's the best way to play it? Offer the local agent a bribe? Claim that the people aren't staying overnight (this would still technically violate the occupancy limit as they would still be on the property)? Other options?

Unfortunately, someone from our group already reached out to Vacasa corporate customer support and asked about an exception, to which they replied ""No, we cannot make exceptions"". I'm assuming this was their canned response. And obviously they do not give out information to contact owners directly. So because they've been contacted, this might make it difficult to play ""dumb"" if the local personnel were to say something. Though I might still be able to feign confusion over their CS response.

Obviously I feel all my remaining options are unethical since I am aware of the occupancy limit, but I don't really feel like anything I'm doing is egregious. The house is designed to sleep 13, and is advertised as having 13 bed spaces. I've tried to ask myself why the occupancy limit is 10 instead of 13, but all I can come up with is that it's either listed incorrectly, or perhaps the owner figured that because it's common for people to go over capacity, they'd preemptively list it lower than it actually is. The sqft and design of the home are on par with tons of other NC beach homes, so it's certainly not a legal / fire code issue. Yes, the owners are potentially innocent victims of my actions here, but it also sucks that Vacasa doesn't allow you to filter by the contractual occupancy limit, so while booking we could have potentially been looking at tons of houses that couldn't accommodate us (although to be honest this scenario is rare, as most houses allow you to fill the advertised bed space).

So I thought maybe he can hire me as ""maid"", conract and all, provide shelter in his house and whatever he pays me, I obviously give him back in the end. We do that for 3 Years, do a civic partnership, and start applying for British citizenship by naturalisation.   


My Bf says that it seems illegal though.  


Am I missing some major flaws there? (except that its dodgy that I am in a partnership with my former ""employeer"" but oh well, love happens) Is there anything illegal about this?

I have a page. I have changed the name many times. If it's a slight edit, it has a filter to allow it, but more significant changes trigger a manual review that can take days. I have had it go both ways, but never been denied a name change.

Today, I updated it by simply adding not- to the start of a word. This passed the filter somehow, even though it could potentially dramatically change the meaning of the page into the opposite of why people liked it.

I don't know if these minor name updates send a notification to followers, but people ignore those, especially if the altered word is at the late-middle or end of the title, likely being cutoff or ignored.

For example, you could start a page called People who like to fuck, and build a following, and then change it to People who like to not-fuck and start posting prude images at people who just wanna see porn.

Or you could make a page called Send us some Bitcoin and we will send double back, but then change it to Send us some Bitcoin and we will not-send double back.

UnethicalLifeProTips,/r/UnethicalLifeProTips/comments/sy61vj/ulpt_what_can_i_do_to_the_guys_that_put_my/,"My brother is on his Journeyman years. He is a carpenter and in Germany there is a tradition where once a young carpenter has finished his apprenticeship as a craftsman, he can join a sort of guild to travel for several years. He has to be single, can't have kids, debt or any criminal history. They go around the world and work and travel. It's a minimum duration of three years and one day. You are not allowed to come back to your hometown. It's pretty cool. Very traditional and dates back to medieval times. They also wear traditional dress in the colours of their trade.

Last week he arrived at an east german town and went to the local inn, where they stay. They have there known meeting spots. When he ""checked in"" he met the daughter of the landlady who invited him to join a party in the bar that belongs to the Inn. It was her birthday. He of course agreed. When he got there they had a good time and he got along well with that girl. So well they stepped outside to smoke and later make out. Then they heared a commotion inside. Somebody was being rowdy and was throwing beer crates. The girl went inside and to the bathroom. When he wanted to go inside two local guys blocked him and said he couldn't go in anymore. They weren't security or anything. Just locals that didn't like him. He told them that's not for them to say. Only the hostess can kick him out and pushed them out of his way. My brother is not a small guy. When he stepped inside the Bar, two men grabbed him from behind and put him in a headlock from behind. They wresseled him down and kneeled on his arms so he couldn't move. Then they started to search his Jacked. He was shouting at them to stopp them and then people seperated them. He was pissed and a showing and pushing started in the course of it my brother slapped on of them. He figured it was probably time for him to leave and went outside. But now three local guys started following him. He was backing away and told them he was leaving but they were drunk and angry and wanted blood. One even broke a bottle and threatened him with the sharp neck. He was backing further away, the three men on his heels, about 50 meters maybe, when a tram came and had to stop because on of the locals walked in front of it. That alarmed the security people that are sometimes on the trams and they came out. He told them what was going on and that they were pursueing him. They told them to go seperate ways and him to go home but on a different route. He did that and basically walked an hour through the town to get back to the hostel from behind, to not run into those three assholes again. When he was almost there, they were waiting for him. The three jumped him and he didn't see them coming. They beat him pretty badly. Then they stole his handmade necktie with the guild needle called ""Ehrbarkeit"" which has a similar function as a cut-off of a biker. They aren't cheap and have strong sentimental value. After they were done, he got up and started looking for it. After a while he realised that his face wasn't right and stopped a passerby to call him an ambulance. The police came with and recorded it as a robbery. Then he was send to the hospital. The result is a broken nose, cheeckbone and teeth.

Is there anything I can do to pay those lowlifes back? I'm sure storys like this aren't uncommon at all. I talked to my brother on the phone and he is doing ok. But I'm completly enraged.

I was able to successfully say that I had a family emergency and my father had to go to the hospital. Although I know it’s terrible to lie that way, my dad has had some minor health issues over the past month, including a head injury that required a couple of staples. So the white lie is believable, and when this happened a couple of weeks ago they didn’t really ask too much about the details. As long as I have a reason for him to have gone back to the hospital, I don’t think they would be angry or ask a bunch of questions, just offer their condolences and lay off me.

Basically what I need help with is coming up with a medical reason why my father had to go into the hospital again for a few days. Something a bit serious, but not SO serious that people are super super concerned for my family, (or instigate more on the details), if that makes sense. 

This is a job I am actively searching to move away from, if that helps my case at all lol. These people hired me under false pretenses, that I would be heading a department and working full time, just to instead demote me to 15 hours a week “for cost saving measures”. I needed a couple days to myself after having a really depressed and anxiety filled week, which they would not have understood, hence the lie.

A coworker of mine who is tech savvy but not movie savvy wants to make a meme to hand to our boss on printed paper his last day before he quits (coworker is planning on quitting and not putting in a 2 week notice).

My friend did not have the backbone to post on here, even though we are all random, to ask what would be the best movie reference to make the meme based on? You know, where you keep the surrounding, the body but you just change the face of the character kind of thing.

Okay, so our workplace is stationed in Minnesota and he have several locations across the state. We need to all temporarily relocate to another location that nobody wants to work in because that location is short staffed. It is short staffed because the management there is mean/condescending... Our boss was confronted by my coworker (the tech savvy guy) about having to go there for a 2 week stint. My coworker is a single dad, his wife just died literally within the last year of COVID. He has no way to get his kids to school, or anyone to watch them.

Our boss's response? ""Well we all need to be a team."" That was his response. Now I need some help finding a movie to have my coworker make the meme of? My first thought was the Human Centipede, where we are all literally connected. But that is not deep enough - another coworker suggested putting his face over the face of the rich guy in Titanic when he abandons the ship?

So I’m not proud of this to say the least and I’m pissed at myself for the situation I got myself in. However my bosses have also screwed me over time and time again (I am currently looking for another job, but also appreciate the experience I’m building while still at this one). 

On Wednesday afternoon, after work (I am only part time) I went home and when my boss texted and called me a couple times, I didn’t answer because they ALWAYS contact me after hours asking for things and I’m sick of it. I’m part time for a reason. I was also having a bad mental health day, and was very anxious to begin with.

After ignoring the 2-3 messages I got, the next morning I had an anxiety attack before going to work over not responding to them (even though it was after work hours), bc they are always passive aggressive over how much work I’m able to get done in a day (yet they demoted me from full time to part time to “save the business money”). So panic stricken, i did work from home for a couple hours and ignored all the texts and calls I got yesterday as well. I didn’T know what to say about the not answering the 2 calls I received the previous night.

I’ve basically ghosted them for a day and a half and don’T know what to do. My anxiety has been through the roof all week, and I let it get to me on Wednesday, but that increased my anxiety further and made me hide out scared to answer anyone from works calls. 

I’ve gotten a bunch of texts asking if I was okay, and I think more petiole seem worried than angry. So I think if I have a good enough excuse I can say that I haven’T been focused on my phone or the outside world. My father has had some health issues recently (minor). Is there some sort of excuse involving him having to go to the hospital for something liver related, etc. that’s serious enough for me to have gone awol for two days but also garners enough sympathy that they’ll understand and be cool with me coming back in next week?

When we do overtime working from home, my company gives out Uber Eats vouchers for our overtime meals. They give them to us as a big list, not privately.

This is amazing and really appreciated.
But I noticed some of my coworkers don't use their vouchers so they're laying around (I noticed when I tried redeemed my code once and actually typed in another one)
I suppose how it works is the company pays the vouchers them gives them out to its employees, so the money is Uber's already. I dont want to redeem those codes if it's stealing from my company. But I don't want Uber to get this money without the vouchers to be redeemed.
I'm also afraid to get caught. 

So I guess my first question is: does Uber get paid when the company is buying vouchers or when the codes are redeemed? 

And then, is there a way for the company to track redeemed codes, and for them to know that one employee is redeeming several codes instead of one? 


Precision: I plan to always wait 48h to try to redeem the codes, this way the people who did overtime that day get the chance to get their code.

My question is if I made side gig income below IRS reporting guidelines, would they ever know if I just didn't report it?

I made income from Airbnb and Etsy (less than $20,000 each, less than 200 transactions each). So both companies say they won't be sending me a 1099 tax form (I know it changes in 2022 but 2021 those are still the requirements). So if they aren't sending me a 1099, they wouldn't be sending the IRS a 1099 on me either. Odds of getting an audit reporting only a single income job (my day job) would be low.

My workplace requires mandatory overtime. My entire year of 2021 was spent at work. Now everyone is quitting/taking an early retirement - which is making even more overtime. I have to wait it out for a few more years because I will lose out of a lot of cash in my pension if I split heals right now. However, I am going to be getting an 8 hour work restriction and am encouraging others who do not want the nonstop forced overtime to do the same. 

Before someone starts with the pro-corporate culture bullshit of ""you need to help your company out"" let me tell you something: Nobody cares. If you work somewhere, even a moderately good workplace and you died right now that workplace would have your job posted on a website for someone to fill your spot before HR would begin the process of getting a card that sits at the front of your workplace that nobody would even notice. This is not being negative, this is being a realist. We all have a finite amount of time on this earth, spend it enjoying a walk on the beach, visiting a family member who is older, donating your time to a charity, etc. 

If anybody wants to know why I say nobody cares - it is because it is true. One of my favorite movies of all time is A Bronx Tale with Robert De Niro. Near the beginning of the movie the kid is talking to the mob boss and they are talking about professional baseball and how the kid is upset because someone made his favorite baseball player cry: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WkP\_S5gmmg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WkP_S5gmmg) 

The mob boss tells the kid basically that that baseball player does not care about him, so do not care about the baseball player back. Near the end of the movie the mob boss gets assassinated and at the funeral nobody truly cares about him dying - because at the end of the day, nobody cares: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh8yOioTKLY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh8yOioTKLY) 

So - be a realist, and f\*ck the workplace who is trying to work you like a f\*cking peasant. YOU take care of YOU. YOU be your best fiduciary. I am beyond sick and tired of all of these workplaces treating people like s\*it and then on top of this trying to tell us all ""you need to stay for another 8 hours"".",ULPT: Work at a place with a lot of mandatory overtime?

This was Bob’s surprise Christmas present from his girlfriend. 

We’ll go to the show, that’s fine, but we REALLY don’t want to stay the night. We have a home literally 40mins from the city and we sleep like dogshit when we’re not in our own beds.

I made the mistake of initially suggesting I might have hotel points to get rooms for both us for free. She never followed up about it until today (2 weeks out from the show) and it turns out I didn’t have the points.

We’ll go to the show, that’s fine. But staying in the city is just a waste of time and a good nights sleep. At the time she reached out I was feeling a bit more extroverted and kind of forgot that sleeping in a hotel sucks. 

When she reached out earlier about it, I mentioned that I didn’t have the hotel points and then hinted that we’d be fine getting some drinks after the show and then heading home if she can’t find any hotels worthwhile. 

Unfortunately that wasn’t a big enough hint and she just sent a hotel to ask if it was okay and if we were to stay for this one stupid night it would be $300. Ugh.

I’ve left her on read because I don’t know the best way to ruin the hotel night idea. Bob is kind of a weirdo and really likes these sleepover events, I don’t know why, so I know he’ll be a bit disappointed but whatever.

UnethicalLifeProTips,/r/UnethicalLifeProTips/comments/sovaot/ulpt_request_my_mother_is_in_constant/,"Hi guys. I'm in a serious bind. I'm a college student living with my (75) mother. She has very bad balance issues and has had to move downstairs to a bed my brother and I set up for her. She will fall without telling me, and gets terrible bursts of pain in her back and just everywhere, but lately it has been really bad.

Today when I came home, I saw her passed out on her bed in a really weird position. I knew something was off. I let her sleep but I had a near heart attack when I checked that she was breathing. When I went to the next room, I saw a wheelchair there, one of those guided ones. I have no idea what the fuck happened to her today while I was gone. All she told me is she took a big fall... but she has concealed this sort of thing from me in the past because she knows that I worry, as I love her beyond measure. About 20-30 minutes ago, I went downstairs for a shower, and while the water was running, I could hear her crying out ""Oh GOD! Please.... please!! Make it... make it STOP! I can't take this... I can't do this... why, why me??!"" This was all in her SLEEP. This must be what she feels all throughout the day. I stopped running the water and ran upstairs to make this post.

I cannot bear to see my mother suffer this way any longer. She has gone to plenty doctors and been to the ER several times but things always come back to this, and we are already struggling financially. We've got good insurance that my dad left us, but the pain just gets worse and worse and worse despite due diligence. It doesn't help that she constantly overworks herself despite my warnings... but I understand she values her independence and all I can do is offer to help everywhere I possibly can.

At a previous time, at her request, I opened her nightstand and got some arbitrary thing for her. I can't remember what honestly. But when I was looking for that, I noticed a pill bottle. It's a prescription written for her. 1 2 to tablets every 6 hours for moderate pain, it says ""OXYCODONE-APAP 5-325 MG TABMCK"". It's from 2009 but I take it that if this were the one bottle in her night stand, she must have been seriously considering taking it. This is saying a lot. She would never ask for this medication and always denies it when offered during her hospital stays, so this must've been from a surgery or something. It appears to be a tablet, so I could feasibly... crush it, and mix it in with a drink so she can find some relief.

She would never take this on her own. As her son, I am faced with a true moral dilemma. I cannot bear to see her this way, but this woman is 30 years sober and takes *immense* pride in her sobriety. She's a psychotherapist too, even with all the physical pain she has appts. over the phone. I don't know what to do, would she be mad at me? Is it justified? Will she be mad... :/ Will she even be able to tell if I give her something? Surely this warrants an exception... what would you guys do? I just.... I can't bear the screams and yelling for help and it's torture feeling so powerless. Thank you.","ULPT Request: My mother is in constant, excruciating pain lately.

A couple of months ago there were some heated feuds and I made the mistake of going along with someone else's idea to set up a new sub which has split that community and caused some rifts. The sub was set up on my main account.

I regret doing that for various reasons, one I don't like moderating, two it's harmed the community as there is less activity on either sub - although the original one is much more active, three I honestly just miss the drama of when we were all on the same sub, I won't say the nature of the subs, but there are strong differences in opinions which leads to entertaining fights. It's the kind of small community that isn't really accessible to new users from other parts of Reddit as its quite insular and all the regulars have years of history, we get new people, but they tend to leave after a few weeks.

I suggested 'closing down' my sub (via making it private) to go back to the original one, but the other mods turned it down. I know them well enough to know it's just about saving face.

UnethicalLifeProTips,/r/UnethicalLifeProTips/comments/sodmru/ulpt_request_am_i_a_landlord/,"so about 2 years ago, i moved into a really shitty, cheap, house with 1 roommate i had known for well over a decade. we split the rent 50/50 even though i had the larger room because it wasn't that much bigger and had other added problems, so it seemed fair. i actually told him i thought we should split equal and he could pick the room, and he picked the smaller one.

after about a year, less than a week before rent was due, he told me was moving out. okay, lame, but whatever, so i started renting out the room. we got a really good deal and rent was expensive in my area, so i advertised the room at a price above half the rent, figuring i could save some money. it worked.

i did not keep consistent roommates, but everyone paid, no major issues, some funny stories for sure. anyway, 1 roommate had a friend who also needed a room. after some talks, we agreed to let them share my (larger) room for a portion of rent. with this addition, i was now collecting about equal to rent on the total house from these 2 roommates while still living there. for reasons, i started just sleeping in the living room and just going to ""my"" room to change clothes or whatever.

eventually, both those guys moved out, so i moved all my belongings to the living room and started renting out both rooms for a combined total of about 50% more than i pay each month for the house but still at one of the cheapest rates per room around.

i am very upfront about all the problems with the property and don't mischaractarize the issues in any way. i also spend time and money each month advertising the property to keep roommates, and don't make them pay utility bills (which i obviously just take out of the rent money they give me, but isn't including flat utility fees legal?)

There was some screw up after the shop handed it over to the shipping company. The tracking never showed as picked up by them. Two or three weeks went by and after complaining the shop sent me a replacement.

But something happened and a week later I got a second one. Then maybe 4-5 weeks later my original tv showed up so I have 3 now.

I never did tell the shop what happened and the other two are still in their boxes unopened.

It’s now early February and since I still heard nothing from the shop after all this time I was planning on reselling them second hand and making a profit.

But then a few days ago I had a missed call and a message from the shop wanting to talk about my order. I ignored the call and they havnt called back.

Would it be safe to now proceed to try and sell them?

The store is quite big and well know with many locations and Im wondering just how determined they may be to try and find their missing stock or just write it off?

It was expensive but we cut back on other things to get a better quality of living and my god was it worth it. When we came, my neighbour was on a 2 month holiday. When they returned, hell began.

Our building is full of professionals. I have never heard a thing from any other apartment including neighbours with babies. We have asked *our* downstairs neighbour if they can hear us and nope, this building is brand new and really well insulated. 

Here’s the important part. My upstairs neighbour is a sort of z-list celebrity in my country. Every Friday and Saturday they have extremely loud parties with banging music until the early hours of the morning. When there’s no music, there’s an intense banging of what I assume is the bed against the wall and loud sexual noises coming from around 10 people. 

At First, i went up and nicely asked them to stop. Both times I did this I was greeted with half naked escorts (just an assumption but what else) who could barely speak the language here. Neighbour is native to this country. I left some polite notes. It didn’t stop and they kept waking my kids and me so I called the police.

He was a little pushy and cunty about it but my friend and I both got up and left with no qualms as soon as he asked. As we walk outside on the street next to the bar the guy is still following us for some reason. It was obvious this guy was trying to be intimidating for some reason and my loud mouth friend tells him to fuck off as we walk away down the street. The guy starts following us down the street trying to goad my friend into a fight. We walk away and I think nothing of it. Last night we go to the same bar and the guy is there and after staring at my id for a while he asks if we were here last week, I say, ""No, I was here last like two weeks ago."" He goes inside and asks my old coworker if we were here two weeks ago and the guy says yes. He comes outside throws my id at me and starts trying to push me away with his fat belly while attempting to be intimidating saying that we are both banned and the police will be called if we are ever at the premises again. My friend and I say nothing and are mildly annoyed and amused but the bouncer made enough of a scene that other patrons outside were shocked that this guy came up to us like that and threatened to call the cops on us for seemingly no reason.

This seems like working at a bar may be a violation of his probation but he may have some special permission.

His son was an addict and sold drugs out of the house. Old man dies. Son ODs and dies soon after. Family from out of state cleans out the house. And intend to sell it.

Now here’s the problem. The sons drug addict friends quickly moved in and have been squatting for months. About a dozen different people come and go all day and night. They filled the yard with trash. The house has no power. I watch them drag obviously stolen items into the house and sell them to people shortly after. I have to assume there are drugs moving through the house. But I can’t prove any crime is being committed.

I call the police when there is a reason. Like a shirtless man hacking the electric meter apart with garden sheers. Or a shirtless man screaming in the yard at midnight taking an imaginary shower. Police come and just tell the guy to be quiet. I get it. It’s not a crime to be a drugged up maniac. But I figure I can at least keep it on police radar?

We tracked down the executor of the will. He was nice and apologized. He lives out of state. And squatters have rights. He can’t kick them out. His plan is to let the house go into foreclosure and have the bank kick them out and clean up the property.

I have a toddler. He sees this crazy stuff. I don’t feel safe seeing the kind of traffic this is bringing to my neighborhood. I found they had been stealing electricity from me (found an extension cord plugged into my exterior outlet). It’s the last straw.

Effectively archive social media and other accounts and limit the potential for account cloning, Identity theft and fraud. ( The problem I see with this is that it limits the ability to do all the other things because it informs the media companies of his death and passwords won't work).

Unfortunately I'm not allowed to work for this employer in a range outside of 25 km away from the office, EVEN THOUGH MY JOB HAS BEEN 100% REMOTE SO FAR. 

The problem? I'm tied to my employer by student debt (we're talking 4 digits). If i quit by myself, then i have to pay it back in full. If i work there for 5 more years it's gone, but this is no option as I am leaving the country in a few months. I cannot really afford to pay it back. 

I know I could just talk to my manager to explain the situation but I know for a fact that I'd have to pay back the whole amount. And thus the only way to get out of this is by letting them fire me. This way I don't have to pay back a cent. 

There are some problems with this though. If they fire me under certain grounds, then by law it's deemed as my own fault, which would cause me to have to pay back this whole thing regardless. 
These grounds for termination include (but are not limited to):
- stealing 
- assault (also includes pooping on my boss desk, please give serious advice)

- Leaking state secrets
- Refusal of work

What can I say to get out of it? I cannot do the ""I just got out of a relationship"" thing as he already knows I wasn't in one recently. I don't want to say anything like I have to take someone to the hospital.

I am thinking about saying I have Covid.

He bluntly lies, we talk about something he did that was shitty for us in our yard, he point his finger and says ""he told me to do it"" at me. We are like WTF , eh is always lying or telling me about how in the past he lied to get his way.

He is building all these illegal suites and dwelling in his shops, we were cool but he has no end in sight, he has 3 now, and next is to but an RV rental right up against our house (illegal) like who does that ? 

On top of all this HE called the city on us while doing LEGAL Renos inside of our house ! 

He is the type of guy that loudly says that I am an asshole so I can hear, and than lies and says I do all this other stuff.

I am self employed and so he constantly makes comments that I don't work. I FUCKEN hate this.

Problem is I have social aniexty and just want o be left alone, this guy wants to see in all my windows and harass me with passive aggressive comments, I avoid him but he is now friends with some of the people in my extended circle, who he lies and starts gossip about me with.

he runs an illegal full time wood shop that is noisily , his dog runs wild and craps all over my hard, he revs his leaf blower when I have guests.

The worse thing he did was called the city building on me. of course I was in the right so no problem but can you imagine ?

he has weapons and is a bully, lair and petty. Normally I would just avoid like the plague.

So far I have tried to avoid problems but I need to step up my game in some ways. I can't leave here, I have to somehow get to point that he shows some respect, and backs off and also maybe gather evidence.

As the title says, I Initiated the breakup last Tuesday, after we’d hung out at my apartment. I did this as he was leaving because of an important work project with deliverables due the next morning. 

Long story short we both had a rough night. I didn’t sleep at all. 

He text me that afternoon. Made arrangements to come get a few things that night before going to his indoor basketball league. Mostly stuff related to the league. When he finally came by seeing how down he looked and acted destroyed me.  It only got worse after he realized I’d also opted to include his house keys with what he’d asked to pick up. 

After he left I was feeling sad and some girlfriends came over to cheer me up. We went dancing. I looked like I was having fun but I was fucking miserable. 

We got back around 2:30 AM. My friends went home. And I was left alone for another sleepless Thursday morning. Thursday was also brutal. But he and I were texting. 

We talked that day and then night he goes to visit his brothers an hour and a half away. Still no sleep for me. If I see him again, im not sure I have the self control to try and get back together. I load most of the Rest of his belongings into my car - trying to weigh if I should return his stuff before he gets home or wait and confess how I’m feeling. I go back inside crying.

Around 9:30 PM my roommate gets home. I’m ugly sad and just and just want to be left alone. When my roommate goes to the bathroom I will leave the house and get into my car. I drive around for a bit trying to think through my insomnia. 

I drive to his place and decide to go sit on his front porch and write him a letter. I go to his side locked side Gate with my phones flashlight on. It’s locked like always and I don’t have my key. So I turned to walk around the side of his house towards the front I look over and see his neighbors Car is running in his driveway, but Can’t tell if he’s in it. I wave in case he is then go towards the front. Once I’m on the porch I’m there for about three minutes and realize this is stupid.

For a little background, I live in a huge apartment complex in Arizona with about 400 units.

Therefore, there is an addendum in our lease that states we are not allowed to store vehicles on property.

So, there's this couple...they drive an SUV and a Honda civic. The SUV is their daily driver and they store the Civic here. My issue is that they store the Civic in the ""first come, first served"" uncovered parking and they park their daily driver in their reserved spot.

I've complained to the office staff, and they did their part by calling the tow and getting the car tagged. I understand that they have to give a notice, but this couple will then move their SUV into the spot where they store the Civic and vice versa.

UnethicalLifeProTips,/r/UnethicalLifeProTips/comments/sbhnxu/ulpt_request_how_avoid_the_impending_massive/,"I'm based in the UK. Last year we had an energy crisis and many of the small providers with good rates went under, customers like me were sold off to bigger energy providers and my bill doubled.

Now, we're expecting another price hike in April of about 30-50%. My average monthly bill went from £55 to £112 for gas and electric, and it'll go up even more.

We can't just use less - we use very little anyway, and the increase is on the energy standing charge (a fixed amount energy companies charge per day, regardless of what you use).

We can't switch providers or tariffs either - no one is accepting new customers or offering better tarrifs.

My current thought is to inflate my usage pre-April, thus paying a lower rate for energy, then report my normal usage post-April, essentially prepaying my energy on the lower rate. E.g., I use 2000 kwatts in March, but I report 2500. In April, my actual usage is 2501. I report that, and only pay for 1 kwatt of energy on the higher tariff. Numbers are just an example of course. I don't think I can squeeze much out of this though.

Any other ideas? I hate these energy companies they're fucking greedy. I rent an apartment for info.",ULPT Request - how avoid the impending massive energy price hike and not pay a fortune on my bills?

I work remotely with a MacBook that was shipped to me directly from Apple but has since had a lot of the company's software installed. I do not use a VPN from the company or one of my own while I work.

I asked during the hiring process if I could travel internationally since I'm remote and they said no. The HR person I asked apparently spoke to someone else because in another meeting another supervisor said ""I heard you asked about traveling and you can't because [blah blah taxes]."" They even told me that people have requested to visit family in Canada for two weeks and have been rejected. So I can't pretend I didn't know. I understand I shouldn't have asked so I could've played dumb. I honestly didn't realize they'd say no. And I couldn't turn the job down because it was a huge improvement from the job that was two weeks away from making me go back to the office during the pandemic.

I have very few meetings (~3-4 hours/week) and they're always on zoom with a virtual background. I actually don't spend very much time talking to coworkers. I am a software engineer and mostly work on my projects on my own. If I work early in the morning or late at night, no one cares. My direct manager specifically told me on his own that if I want to travel I should and just not mention it to HR. He has done a lot of traveling and he understands. He is actually in Mexico right now and told me that I'm the only one in the company who knows because we've talked about traveling before. He says no one has mentioned anything. But Mexico is not in a time zone that causes red flags.

My work does not involve anything that is a security risk or HIPAA or anything. I do front-end engineering for a makeup company. I have previously worked for a company based in the UK while I was living in Thailand and managing a team in the US. No one had any idea I wasn't in the US. I can juggle the time zones. I just don't want to be fired because of some VPN issue I'm not thinking of. I know that Slack says which time zone you're in, so I'll need to think of a solution for that.

It's also cumbersome and expensive for merchants to refute, so normally they don't bother or it isn't financially reasonable for them to investigate every chargeback.

This is so effective that some companies have terms in their usage agreement where initiating a chargeback bans your account (e.g. games that have microtransactions) because they have almost no ability to stop you aside from preventing access to the platform entirely.

## **BUTT** the better thing to do is to **get** a credit card that has **purchase protection instead**, then you can legitimately claim for basically *anything,* even water damage or theft.

UnethicalLifeProTips,/r/UnethicalLifeProTips/comments/s70mgd/ulpt_request_my_friends_pedophile_boyfriend_is/,"TL;DR: my friend’s boyfriend is a pedophile, putting her and her two kids in danger and he needs to go. 

Hi all. I’m friends with a woman in my neighborhood, we’re decently close. She works very hard, sometimes doing 12 hour shifts for her children. She’s got two kids, one is seven, and the other is 13 with autism. She’s a single mother, or at least she was single until a few months ago.

That’s when she started dating this new guy. Now, she’s had a tougher life than most. Adopted from a country far away, abandoned by her parents. Her adopted parents treated her very well, but she had a little bit of a rebellious streak when she got older and went and joined the Air Force. Afterwards, she got married to a man who would eventually leave her after he revealed his true nature, but not before giving her a son with autism, who she now could only raise herself. She then quickly got remarried. She was desperate for help and love I think and the first marriage really deeply hurt her. This man also turned out to be a conman, who took advantage of her and cheated on her before leaving the country. He gave her a daughter.

It’s been several years since then and she’s been striking it out alone at as a nurse, which has been especially hard from covid. Like I said she’s worked 12 hour shift. I’ve had to babysit her kids before for 12 hours straight. She’s been doing decently well for herself, but I guess she still felt empty because a few months ago she started dating this guy. When I met him, he seemed totally normal, a little bit awkward, how you’d expect. But we were all fooled I guess.

I found out from her family that he was a really fucked up dude. I only know about one thing that he’s done, and that’s because they refuse to tell me about it. But I did research and found out he did seven years for raping a minor. Not only that, but her family hinted at him being abusive on some level. They have tried everything to help her, but there’s no evidence of anything bad he’s done and he gets checked by the state every once in a while to make sure he’s not raping any kids I guess. I think she’s afraid to leave him.

He moved in with her quickly and quit his job, so now he’s just a freeloader. I doubt my friend wanted any of this to happen, and it’s a terrible situation. Especially because she spends half her time away from her home, and her kids, while they are mostly at school during that time, spend a lot of time alone with the boyfriend, who only ever leaves to go to a friends. I’m afraid he is a threat to those kids. I watched those kids grow up, they’re like family to me. They’re the sweetest kids I’ve ever met and it would crush me if they were hurt. 

So I decided I needed to do something. I’m not sure what I can do though. Calling the cops is off the table because there’s obviously no physical proof that he is a danger, and would probably piss him off, putting him in more danger. One plan I had was to convince her to let me babysit her kids again, and then investigate the boyfriend’s stuff, like his computer or tablet if he has one, or any other personal belongings. I feel like it’s possible he may have something illicit on his computer. Right now I have two phone numbers that are potentially his, his vehicle information, his sex offender registry, and where he lives and where he used to work. That’s all I’ve been able to find. He doesn’t seem to have any social media.

I’m making this (very long, sorry) post because I need ideas of what I can do. I have to do something, as long as my friend and her kids are in danger, he needs to go. I could frame the guy but I don’t know how. I could just make his life inconvenient and smear Vaseline on his windshield. But I know you guys are good at this stuff.

I  dated a woman who was having sex with a variety of men. Nothing wrong  with that as far as I was concerned, except one of the men was married,  and cheating.

She defended her behavior saying that she was not harming his wife, he was.

I am no carpenter, but I built it with the correct distance from the road according to the USPS rules and have the post set in concrete, but in 3 years my mailbox has been hit upwards of 5 times. I have had pieces of bumpers left, skid marks in my ditch where people drove off the road and hit the mailbox, and various other marks from people driving irresponsibly. We live on a high traffic road for people trying to avoid highways or DUI checkpoints and people drive way too fast for a residential street. We have contacted the city many times about people speeding or driving recklessly, but the road is too narrow for them to really install any kind of deterrent. We have even put on reflective stickers as well as reflective poles so it is obvious even at night, but it still gets hit. I have a Ring camera that is facing the road where the mailbox is, but I can't really get the sensitivity right so it only captures people hitting my mailbox and not every car that drives down my road. The most recent hit on my mailbox broke the wooden post at the base and made me think, ""If I can't deter people from driving stupidly, how can I do the most damage when someone does hit it?"" So that is what I am looking to do. I want to go about this as legally as possible, but if someone were to hit it and flee, I want their vehicle to be branded so they know they messed up.

Our property management company typically doesn’t have a clue as to what’s going on and during the last lease renewal, there was no conversation about renewing. All that they did was send us an updated lease for another year at the same price.

Annoyed by their history of negligence, my roommate and I never signed the new lease. This new lease was supposed to be from 9/1/21-8/30/22. After not signing, we never heard a word and we’re invoiced $0 each month in the online portal.

Fast forward to now, the property management company has noticed their mistake and has requested all of the money owed for the lease that was never signed.

My neighbours and their kids have been making my life a living hell for the past two and a half years and I've tried every possible 'nice' approach I can and nothing works.

Some background, I am a foreigner (expat) in the Netherlands. I bought a house in a good area 2,5 years ago. From the moment I moved in my neighbours have been making xenophobic and racist remarks (which I'm used to so it's ok). Their children (11 and 13) yell and scream till who knows what hour every night. I mean massive temper tantrums and the mother responds with the same amount of aggression. We live on top of eachother and the slightest noise we hear, so we have to be accomodative. But they scream and bang on the walls so much that my paintings fall off. For context there has been over 116 incidence since 24 November (the municipality told me to log the incidence) which lasts anything from 20 mins to 3 hours.

Their kids have climbed on my car and jumped on the bonnet. They throw stones against my Windows. They put fire crackers inside my mailbox (which leads into my house). I saw the one kid also throw crackers in my car's exhaust. The list goes on endlessly.

I've tried to be accomodative and had civil discussions with the parents in the past. This didn't work. I asked them politely to be more considerate. They just tell me it's children and there is nothing they can do. The kid as anxiety issues. One evening at around 23:55, I went over and asked them again very politely if they can keep their kids for yelling as it's already almost midnight. The husband started yelling at me in Dutch and told me to go back to my own country if I don't like it as they have a right to do what ever they want. This triggered me. 

I then started to report incidents after 23:00 to the police and to the municipality. They told me to take notes about incidents and make recordings. I've been doing this for a month now. Anyways...

This weekend they left and this morning at 7 am I started hearing extreme hammering and drilling. They started renovating their bathroom. We are in a Lockdown and we all work from home. They have a company with heavy machinery drilling down the walls and yeah seeing that we live in houses literally attached to one another, it's like drilling in my own home. I asked.the construction people how long this would go on for... And here is the kicker... 6-8 weeks. They told me the owners asked specifically for them to start at 7 am to 'annoy the fucking neighbor'. 

To put it lightly, they are driving me insane. I'm angry, frustrated and anxious all the time. I don't get any sleep (as I have to be up at 5am.every day).. there has t been a day in the lady 9 weeks where I've had more than a couple of hours of peace.

I had a childhood girlfriend (we'll call her Valerie) back when we were both young teenagers and we almost got together in bed. Because I was stupid, I missed signals and never got to have any sexy time with her. Now, I'm married but in a DB and have reconnected with Valerie on social media. We are both in our very late 40s. She looks to be single with a couple kids and lives about 45-60 minutes from me. We chat about work, life, and music, but I REALLY want to see what I was missing. She is still very attractive to me and I think I am even more attractive to her.

How can I slip in things into our conversations that will get her interested in getting together for some under the sheet time? None of her posts indicate that she is religious. I've already told her that one of her pictures on her posts was adorable, but I didn't get a reaction that indicated that she was flattered. She's having a stressful time at work and I have shown support and tried to give advice. She has a dog as well. Just trying to give all the info that may be useful.

There are potential times that I will have a reason to go to the city she lives in while she is off. I thought that when that happens, I'd make sure to ask her if she'd like to get together for coffee, drinks, or dinner, but I'd really like to have that transition into ""why don't we go back to my place for a bit"" from her... She rents her home and does not make a lot of cash if that helps. I am quite well off.

I am positive there are guys on this sub who know how to work this situation. Please help me out.","ULPT Request: Ya gotta help me, please!!! Want to hook up with a childhood girlfriend..."

Once I walked out the employee said they saw me on camera stealing the batteries. 

However I wasn’t fully out the store yet. And I just said I’ll pay for them because I had the money. It ended up being like $30 bucks. But he said if I came back to that Best Buy they would call the sheriff on me. Im never shoplifting agian because getting caught is terrible. And it’s just not worth the risk. I’m so embarrassed.

That also explains why she didn't have any negative reviews that would warn us before hiring her.

I've also put negative review on Google but she is not very active there. She is mostly active on Facebook but I can't put a negative review on her Facebook page as it is only a page (as opposed to a business page).

Besides Umbridge-like abuses of power on a small scale, she tried to seriously ruin my education. Basically, she accused me (falsely) of something grievous and tried to expedite the process to get me kicked out of university with no scrutiny to determine whether her accusations were right.

Specifically, she called me into her office on false pretenses and tried to get me to sign a document without reading it. It was a letter, supposedly FROM ME, ""confessing"" the things she accused me of. She screamed threats at me to stop me from reading the confession, and she tried to physically wrestle the document out of my hands. I escaped her office and tried to use that document to defend myself, but she then denied ever writing that confession or ever trying to get me to sign it. Her word was taken as gospel and the letter was never taken as evidence of Mrs. Fuckface's evil acts. Eventually, I was judged by a disciplinary council, I was thoroughly proven innocent, but Mrs. Fuckface never faced any consequence for her crimes, her lies and her false accusations.

Years later, I met a former student of the same university who DID get expelled in exactly the same way, because she signed Mrs. Fuckface fake confession letter after being promised by Mrs. Fuckface that, if she signed the letter, that would be the end of it.

It's not enough for them to quietly make their terrible choice, they have to inform everyone around them about it... at great length.

I've found an effective way to shut them up -- create cognitive dissonance in their minds by pointing out how similar this behavior is to the stereotypical behavior of vegans. The same propaganda stream that tells them to be anti-vax has been mocking and putting down vegans for years, so there's a lot of entrenched ""us"" versus ""them"" mentality in their heads.

And I can understand why vegans need to discuss their lifestyle somewhat frequently -- they want to make sure they have their preferred food options available. The point of this post is not to disparage vegans (beyond the usual gentle ribbing), but rather to leverage the built-up antipathy that has arisen from the alt-right drinking from the same predictable propaganda fire hose for years.

As a side note, that means that this technique is aimed at the right-wing anti-vaxxers -- you know, the ones who think the pinnacle of masculinity is Putin riding shirtless on a horse.

I've called around nearly a dozen local places, and none work with home warranty companies so I have to go with their in house. My neighbor moved in near same time and used them in a similar circumstance - a 27 year old! refrigerator went out, they refused to replace and instead just put in some part for it to limp along until he's no longer under warranty. It was immediately making noise and not cooling well, but it ""worked"" so they washed their hands and he was still out around $330 between the deductible and service fees.

When I was about 13 years old, I “dated” a girl I’ll call Dayna that I thought I loved, and she thought she loved me. We almost had sex but did not. Probably a good thing because there may have been a pregnancy or other emotional problems. We broke up because we were stupid, immature children.

I moved on and now almost 47 years later, I have gotten married and absolutely love my wife. But she has recently become asexual and does not enjoy sex at all. She has also said that she doesn’t care if I stray, she just does not want to hear anything about it.

I have recently reconnected with Dayna on Facebook and I don’t believe she is in a relationship.

She lives about an hour from me and we have been talking on messenger for about five years. There has been nothing romantic or sexual talked about. BUT, looking at her pictures, I REALLY want to fuck her. She’s popped out a couple kids and gotten a job in the medical industry.

There’s NO way I will leave my wife for her (or anyone else) but I have been in a mostly dead bedroom situation for a couple years.

Women in the medical profession seem to have a much better understanding of their bodies and enjoy sex a LOT more than regular women.

I really need to know if you have any ideas on how to move forward in the Facebook chat where I could end up sleeping with her.

I know that for some people this advice really worked. But, I have a counterargument in the form of a recent occurrence.

My wife was applying for a job at a hospital and wanted to enhance her resume. So, we ""combined"" her experience at two different grocery stores of the same chain into one and included her experience in a more senior position toward the end as part of her duties. So, my wife had a combined 4-6 months experience spread out over a year at two different stores and she was a department facilitator at one for about 2 weeks. But *on her resume*, it looked like she facilitated one store's department for an entire year.

When she applied, the hospital actually worked with a company called Sterling to verify her employment and when they couldn't definitively prove that she worked at this store for a year, they asked *her* to prove her time there. They asked for pay stubs, manager's information, and even asked for *W2s!* She said she couldn't prove she worked there as long as she did because the company deleted her employee data (which was true, the company retaliated in response to her quitting without notice by deleting her access to her stubs and W2s, which is probably illegal and I'm sure will be a fun hassle come tax season).

Now, she got hired anyway in the end *but* I count her extremely lucky. Your mileage may vary, I imagine that since they asked her that question, they'll ask others the same. I presume they may cancel the rest of the hiring process depending on your answer, if they feel you're lying and they don't want to take on the risk of hiring you.

So my dad is a piece of shit and doesn’t contribute to rent and what not, hoards all the money he makes to himself because he doesn’t trust my mom (that’s a whole issue entirely)

So we had a car accident a few years ago and we were supposed to receive 4 cheques for each of us for compensation and injury. We received 3 of them together under my dad, my moms and my name. I wasn’t 18 back then and I couldn’t really talk back to my dad so I had to cash my cheque and give it to him.

We were waiting for my younger brothers cheque but it never came.

His cheque came April of 2021, when my dad wasn’t in the country. So we cashed it and used it to pay our rent and what not, to give us some breathing room. I was supposed to dispose the letter which was enclosed with the cheque but that’s where I messed up.

Now my dad back and he found the letter stating the amount and stuff. But because of the fact his English isn’t the best, he didn’t understand it and hasn’t realized that the cheque was ENCLOSED with the letter, so he asks me to contact the solicitors and ask for them for the cheque.

He is a stingy, oppressive person and I don’t want to give him the money as it isn’t his in the first place. But I can’t simply say that “its not yours”. There are lots of family issues preventing me to say all that.

It’s a long slender arm, I’m sure you’ve seen the type. Somebody in front of me scanned in to open the gate and I pulled in behind them as I’ve done dozens of times and also seen others do. The arm always senses there’s a car there and raises back up. This time it didn’t, and I think my roof rack caught the arm and ripped it off as a I drove through.

Luckily there’s not really any damage to my car. Should I say anything?

Reasons to justify my side: The past few days the gate wouldn’t open at all for some people and they had to park in the street. My roommate said it was bent and damaged as if it had closed on other cars before mine and mine just happened to break it. Other tenants also say since it started malfunctioning it seemed to close quicker and looked like you couldn’t do more than one car at a time anymore or maybe the sensor no longer worked.

The apartment side: they’ll probably just say it’s designed for one car at a time and try to charge me for it. They’re terrible management. It’s taken them over a year to repair a plumbing issue in my unit and they cause more damage trying to fix it. Everyone complains about them.

The evidence: there is a camera in the back facing towards the gate entrance/exit. You can’t see any license plate info driving in, but you can see it going out. I’d guess they’d watch the cameras to see what kind of car did the damage, and then watch for the same car to drive out so they can get the plate info. I haven’t left the complex yet.

It pays a little above minimum wage but this is the first high paying job *for me* in my experience. It's a serious game changer for me, I've gone through 2 drug screenings, 2 FBI checks and 2 child abuse clearances for both my main employer and the company that hired me through it.

My first job was at Uni working with food on campus. Unfortunately, it's now a defunct eatery and it disbanded in 2019. I dropped out in 2018. All my co-workers and managers were seniors or getting ready to graduate so they're obviously long gone.

My second job was in retail in 2018, I only worked there 2 months before cracking under the pressure and asking to be relieved. I've since then made a full recovery for my mental health and with therapy, I'm in a position to actually work on becoming a young independent adult.  
But the kicker is, they're very deadset on me having 7 references. I've tried explaining to the recruiter multiple times that I can't find anyone due to my first job not being available and when I tried to call my second place of employment, the fucking manager hung up on me twice when I asked for her contact information. They're being completely uncooperative.

I did some volunteer work in 2018 when I had a minor drug record but its since been expunged. I don't feel very comfortable with contacting the shelter I worked at and asking them for a reference for obvious reasons.

The recruiter was able to talk to her boss and she was able to dumb it down to 3 references minimum. I've seriously been tempted to just ask my mom, aunt or uncle if they could fill in for me if I created a fake email and wrote them down as professors/colleagues/peers. etc. They're more then willing to help me but I'm extremely concerned that my employer will find out they're not professional.

I'm terrified of losing this job, they said they can push back my start date if I can't find anyone by this Thursday \[12/30\] I start working next month. The recruiter said they're not responsible for actually reaching out and calling my old employers, I have to be the one to list them down. They do it through a system called Harver. I just need to put down a first name, last name and email. It then sends them a survey they can rate about me.

Title, essentially. This is in the US.

I wanted to get a vasectomy. You know what I did? I called my insurance and asked politely for one. You know what they did? They said, ""Sure, here's a video you should watch. Appointment is in January."" No problem, buddy.

It sickens me, though, it truly does, to know that in so much of our industrialized, wealthy, progressive nation, most women will get denied a tubal ligation without permission from their husbands because ""what if you change your mind?"" or ""what if your husband wants kids?"" even if having one will literally complicate your health or even kill you. It's baloney, that's what that is. Unadulterated poppycock.

So here's my inelegant solution which I would be doing for free as a volunteer because the system is restrictive and stupid. I find one of these women who want the procedure (""how do I find them?"" is another question - or more specifically, ""how do I advertise this service?""), I walk into their OB/GYN appointment with them with a cheap wedding band I buy on eBay to match my ""wife's"" most dazzling cubic zirconia, and I say, ""Why yes, I am Mr. Woman's Husband, and I do solemnly swear that I give my permission to Mrs. Woman to do the little snippety snip.""

Obviously I have not worked most of the kinks out of this plan, but I want to help women who are struggling against our draconian American puritanism and wanna just not have to worry about getting pregnant. Do these offices do background checks? How do they even verify they got the husband's permission? Written letter? Form filled out in triplicate? Is this an insurance thing or is it a doctor thing (and thus will I have to convince one guy in a lab coat or twelve dudes in an office with my documents?)

UnethicalLifeProTips,/r/UnethicalLifeProTips/comments/rmwv09/ulpt_request_how_can_i_deal_with_my_psychotic/,"Hello, i apologize for the formatting, this is written on mobile.

I've lived in my current rental property for around 8 months, 4 months ago my new neighbor, Kurt, moved in. He has not been sober since. He introduced himself as a 56 year old bankrupt investment banker, shortly after moving in. Initially, he seemed like a decent person, besides making weirdly sexual jokes, but I chalked them up to be the result of the rum and coke in his hands.

Around two weeks after Kurt moved in is when the issues began. It was, at first, small things like him asking for a key to out house, or demanding we allow his son to walk our very anxious rescue dog. 

A few days after we refused his request, my room mate was cleaning out his car. During which time Kurt came out of his house and started screaming (loud enough that you could hear it down the block) at my roommate that we were supposedly abusing our dog. As I said above, our dog has sever separation anxiety and abandonment issues, she is significantly improving, but at that time, whenever we would leave the house she would cry, usually for about 20 minutes. Kurt interpreted her crying as us torturing the dog in some way, despite us not being around.

Due to the front yard screaming match caused by Kurt, the RCMP were called. They showed up and immediately went and knocked on Kurt's door. He responded with something like ""no one named Kurt lives here, I don't know who that is"" (the police already knew his name, red flag). 

Many other instances of him starting screaming matches with both me and my roommates, aswell as with other neighbors. Other neighbors of ours have also said that he has randomly shown up while they were having camp fires, and stared from over the fence.

I am writing this tonight, however, because I have just been woken up at 3 am by him smashing the side of my house with a snow shovel, while he screamed ""SHUT THE FUCK UP"". He was upset that my window was slightly open with a fan in it, while my TV played at low volume. 

I responded to him, in a dazed state, something like ""You better shut the fuck up and go back in your house"" and then called him ""a sad, old, geriatric man"". Kurt responded with various expletives and then began to throw ice, rocks and snow into my second story bedroom window, while incomprehensible screaming. 

My computer desk is located directly infront of the window, the snow destroyed the fan in the window, and soaked my keyboard and mouse pad in dirty water. 

Could anyone suggest me a way to make his life so terrible that he moves out? I have a part of the interaction, notably the part of him throwing Ice into my house, recorded.",ULPT REQUEST: How can I deal with my psychotic neighbor?
UnethicalLifeProTips,/r/UnethicalLifeProTips/comments/rmumud/ulpt_amazon_fake_return_got_refunded_the_original/,"So a friend of mine recently went a bit crazy and bough a whole bunch of stuff on amazon, and returned fake stuff for a refund.

&amp;#x200B;

He tried to be subtle about it, choosing stuff that weigh the same etc.

&amp;#x200B;

But the last 3 refunds got him dumbfounded.

&amp;#x200B;

To give an example, he bought a fisheye lens for 90 bucks, and replaced it with a lens adapter, exactly same size, same weight, that cost him 20 bucks years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

Similarly, he bought a book for 80 bucks, and replaced it with another book he bought for 25 bucks years ago. Same size, same weight etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Both fake replacements were also bought on amazon.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, he got refunded for the fisheye lens AND the adapter he bought on amazon in 2018. Same with the book, he got refunded for the $80 book AND the $25 book he bought in 2019.

&amp;#x200B;

But it gets even weirder. He says the book is not that weird, as it has a barcode and they might have just scanned it and refunded it automatically (even though it was bought 3 years ago).

&amp;#x200B;

The lens adapter didn't have a barcode whatsoever. It means someone took it out, examined it, looked at his purchase history, found the article by brand name only, and refunded it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Usually when he does small time scams like that, it's for articles that cost around 10-20 bucks. This is the first time he went for \~$100 stuff.

I am not a fat cat landlord looking to mess with struggling tenants. I finally have enough money to buy my wife her dream home and the former owners who have post possession are using their lawyer to block me from doing basic and much needed maintenance that they knew needed done. 

Backstory: 

My wife’s dream home came up for sale in our neighborhood. Three blocks away from our current house. Gorgeous place built by a family that had to sell it at a loss in ‘08 scooped up by a doctor and his family. Doctor divorces his wife and now he and his new wife want something in a swankier neighborhood. So they put the house in the market and get multiple offers over asking price on the first day, including ours. They choose ours because we are willing to let them stay from our closing in winter for three months (it’s called post possession) until their new house gets done. 

Idk why they put their house on the market not ready to move, but it is what it is. 

The inspection of the house is ok, not great. The tankless hot water heater has never been serviced, cleaned, maintained and has an active leak. The HVAC units also appear to never have been serviced and several parts are in their last leg. The air filters are the wrong size for the intake and very old and covered in dust and dog hair. There are three dead trees in the corner of the yard. 

We ask that they take care of these things prior to closing. They refuse. They offer a credit for the biggest issue, the tankless hot water heater.  Our agent and their agent agree that they will cover the cost of getting everything tuned up and not to let these issues complicate closing. 

We spoke to the sellers and they agreed to let us tune up the HVAC and change the filters at our cost. I get a call from my arborist and he says he can take out the trees in 90 minutes all cleaned up and won’t need access to inside the house. 

The good doctor refuses all of this. 

Now I get mail saying that under penalty of legal action we are not allowed on the premises to do anything until they vacate the premises. 

The good doctor seemed nice enough  but it’s obvious that anything blue collar including is not in his wheelhouse. The maintenance will not get done. I am not asking for anything unreasonable. In fact everything will benefit them. Now all of a sudden I am having to get letters from his lawyer?

Long story shortish, I had several sessions of physical therapy for a shoulder injury in the spring of this year. I checked with my insurance company (Aetna) before starting and was told I would only ever owe a co-pay on each session.

After I finished my final session, I was told by my physical therapist that I owed an additional $107 for my first session, because that was an initial medical assessment and carried an additional charge in on top of my co-pay. I explained that I had checked with my insurer and was told that I only owed my co-pay. They said okay and that they would work it out with Aetna.

Fast forward a little and it turns out I was given bad information by the CSR I had talked to at Aetna. I did actually owe the additional amount for that first session. There was eventually a follow up request for payment by my physical therapist, which I ignored out of (A) foolishness and (B) because I thought I was in the right at the time.

Eventually this showed up on my credit report as a delinquent collection and tanked my credit score by about 100 points overnight (780 to 680).

**My question is, how do I best handle it from here to restore my credit rating?** It is only $107, which I don't have a problem paying, but my understanding is the collection will still show up on my credit report and hurt my score. Obviously it is better to have it paid than an active collection, but I would ideally like to have it completely expunged if possible.

I already appealed the charge with Aetna, and had my initial appeal denied. Is it worth potentially leaving negative reviews for the physical therapist company in an effort to get them to revoke the charge, or does that even matter now that it has already gone to a collection agency?",ULPT Request: How to best handle a Medical Collection on my credit report?

The house was vacant for years and we always hoped for someone to move in because we didn't enjoy living next to an abandoned house. The house got put up for rent and I've since learned that it goes for around $1,100/month. We learned to be careful what you wish for. 

The father: He seems like a recluse with a foul personality. He never waves or says hello, just drives in and out of his driveway for work and is rarely seen otherwise. I believe he works a night shift and I guess that might partially explain his personality. The only positive I've observed is that ever since he had grandchildren he seems to love them a lot and can be seen taking care of them every once in a while.

Daughter #1: Bad news from the start. A typical ""hood rat"" that slept around a lot. My brother in law claims that she used to eye him around a lot and compliment his height, or so he says. But she has hooked up with the son of the only other problem house in the neighborhood (About five years ago that house was under siege by the police. Apparently the father was under the influence of drugs and held his family hostage. I think they've since moved out of the neighborhood). The daughter and boyfriend were both in and out of prison for years. 

One time when I was in the back yard watching television I heard her in their backyard spontaneously screaming and crying like a lunatic. I thought for sure she was getting her ass beat, but hilariously she had missed her BF getting dragged off to jail for two years and she was crying about that instead. Scared the shit outta me regardless because of how sudden, loud, and dramatic it all was. 

She has had two babies and I'm willing to bet they're from different fathers, no father has ever been seen anyways. 

Daughter #2: She clearly looks up to her sister. Graduated HS a few years ago, but has been dressing like a $20 hooker for years now. Haven't actually seen her in a while so maybe she moved out(?)

Son: Nice kid, still in HS. A few years back when he was 13-14 he came to our house late at nights scared shitless. He told me and my brother in law (he visits a lot because my mother babysits his kids) that some guys made their way into the house claiming to be friends of his sister's. He couldn't get them to leave and felt afraid because he had been left all alone. His father had gone off with some friends to camp out in the desert, and his sister's were out for the night. We went over but the guys were gone. This is the only time that I've ever stepped foot in their house and I was left mortified at what I'd seen. 

The house is a two bedroom but sleeps over five people. As such, there are three beds (one bunk bed) in the living room, the kitchen cought fire a few years ago and is still in disarray, garbage strewn everywhere. Its a disaster.

The garage looks like it's bursting with more fucking shit. the backyard resembles a landfill but with much less class and organization. The front yard features untrimmed trees that once housed a large raccoon. The fence all around the property is barely standing. 

They also have a dog that they let wander the neighborhood whenever she needs to potty. Guess where she shits? Right outside my bedroom window. 

They have recently started hosting their driveway as like a ghetto-ass Airbnb. I once saw a guy sleeping in a sack well into the afternoon and I legit thought he was dead. About a week ago some guy was living in a van and I'd hear him yelling threats like a lunatic into his earpiece (I'm going to level with you I don't think he had an earpiece). 

The point is I want these people gone. I wouldn't be surprised if their dilapidated house lowers the value of the entire neighborhood by a collective millions of dollars. It's an eyesore to see whenever I want to enjoy my front yard. I feel unsanitary when the breeze comes down from the direction of their entire property. It's truly depressing how little they care because it's not like they own anyways.

Ive considered arson because of the trash that collects in their back yard but fire spreads and I also don't want to kill anyone, especially the grandkids. Also, it's overkill in my opinion, but I lack the legal expertise or imagination for something less chaotic and more effective.

Most shopping mall car parks these days have number plate recognition, so if you lose your ticket you can press the help button, give the staff member your license plate number and pay your parking fee.

So instead, make a note of the number plate for someone that just pulled into the car park, grab a coffee and wait 20 mins so they enter the charging period, then when you pay for your ticket, press the help button and give them the new license plate number and only pay for 1 hour.

UnethicalLifeProTips,/r/UnethicalLifeProTips/comments/rj9hld/ulpt_have_employment_gaps_in_your_resume_put_your/,"If your resume is filled with employment gaps, it becomes increasingly harder to land interviews or get job offers. Companies want perfect candidates, which frankly isn't realistic. Explaining employment gaps oftentimes will disqualify you out of the running. 

I firmly believe in the mantra that if you're able to do a job then say and do whatever you have to do to land that role. 

Most companies hire really lazy and shitty 3rd party background checks like HireRight or GoodHire who do the absolute bare minimum to validate employment. 

It's really standard that a company won't call your current employer, so you can fudge your dates to be whatever you want them to be. I've pulled this off successfully several times with some really high paying roles in the tech industry. 

Sometimes as a condition of employment, they may ask for something like a W2 or a recent paystub, just take an old paystub or W2 and edit the information. Background check companies are under pressure to get candidates in and out as fast as possible and won't take the time to investigate. 

Also, some of the worse background check companies like HireRight will just call the numbers you provide. Hosted VoIP companies like Ring Central allow you to create 1800 numbers, so do with that information if you want to go the extra mile. 

This works exceptionally well with small businesses or start ups but also works for some big billion dollar corporate overlords. 

95% of the time background checks will consist of verifying your most recent 3 employers, so feel free to fudge the early part of your career. 

Want a leadership role? My last job I was a manager. Nobody will check shit.

He can barely talk English and I can't understand him 90% of the time. He tried convincing me that a light bulb was a camera. He talks down to women saying that once his old GF didn't make him dinner before she left so when she got back he hit her for it. 

But the final straw was yesterday night. I went to the toilet in the communal place/lobby as I was not gonna make it to the one in my room and this MF'er saw me and then sat outside the bathroom door waiting for me BUT when he tried to shake my hand there was fucking cum on his hand! Like I tried to think it was lotion or something but when I had a second look it was 100% cum. He musta realised at some point because he wiped it off. He also tried to insist that my GF is cheating on me when she goes to her babysitting job, I've told him not to disrespect her like that but he just doesn't understand me.

Hey, thanks in advance for the help, using my porn alt ofc because I don’t want to share this on my main that has connections to me. Sorry for the wall of text in advance I’m to angry to care about anything rn.

About two weeks ago my little sister came home from her highschool and wouldn’t talk to anyone, me being a bum ass older brother who dropped outta college grew a heart that day and asked her what’s wrong. She opened up to me and told me what’s wrong and it still fucks me up remembering what exactly she told me. Tears across her face she told me all about how her boyfriend took her to this Holliday season party and how after a while he got intoxicated and started groping her, in all honesty she said this isn’t that big of an issue until he began pestering her more and more for sex. Him and another drunk buddy of his “walked” (read: pushed) her upstairs into a quiet empty room at this party and the friend left and held the door shut. That’s when he took most of her clothes off and began to take off his when she pulled his knife out of his pants and threatened to stab him if he didn’t let her leave NOW. Ofc he used his only two braincells and let her go and she walked home at about 11:00. Now about four days ago my parents consulted a lawyer and booked her for therapy and this lawyer they consulted said that there aren’t any legs for the case to stand on and that he can’t help us, especially since there were no marks on her and lack of proof. This lead me here, so I ask you.

But the level of education, is the level of education YOU THINK you have, it means that you can totally overvalued your level of education.

Basically my grandfather is horrible. He is racist, sexist, and homophobic and just all around bigoted. He also terribly abused my grandmother and mother for years.

He has had cancer for the last few years, and im not entirely sure how it works but it seems to go away for awhile and then a new Tumor will be found. He is also getting quite old, so I’m not sure how much longer he’ll be around.

Before anyone gets upset about this please remember the sub we’re in, and I also don’t wish to go into how truly horrible he is in a random post. 

Here’s the situation:

He lives in another city from me quite far away. I rarely see him in person. I have been contacting him over text occasionally to try and build some sort of relationship. He doesn’t have too many assets, just the home he lives in in a retirement village. I would mainly be looking to get a cut from the house.

He has 2 children (my mother and uncle) and only 2 grandchildren (me and my brother). My grandmother has passed away. He also has a sister with a large family who he is much closer with. Do I have any chance of receiving anything in this scenario? I’m not sure if he has a will or what’s in it, and I’m scared that brining it up will ruin what I’ve  been trying to do. I never really talk to my uncle or my extended family on this side. Me and my brother are both adults.

What can I do to increase the chances of me getting anything at all? I am at a stage in my life where any amount of money would be helpful, and i have no respect for this man at all after everything he’s done.

My upstairs neighbors are tyrants, stomping/slamming doors all day and night for seemingly no reason (no kids, and just a cat) we think they might have a drinking or marriage issue. It is so loud at times our ceiling lights will shake and their favorite hour is 2am-3am. 

The leasing office does not care at all! They send someone to record outside the door, without leaving a note or contacting them at all. 

In fact, we are pretty sure they offered us a penalty-free lease break so they can make more money because rent inflation/housing prices are insane here. The next people will have the same problem and they can just make a revolving door of money.

Of course, we initially tried reasoning with them in person and with notes, (which the leasing office sent us a written warning for 'harassment' even though we all spoke calmly and the notes were civil, mmmk, tattletales, nice!) and they just lied and played dumb. Actually had the gall to say it was the people above THEM who were stomping... Maybe I look gullible? Idk.

I am aware that my employer could be using software that monitors my every move in real time. But I doubt it. That would take resources and it’s not a big enough concern that they’d do that. But Outlook has its own mailbox auditing feature.

1- Does it have to be turned on ahead of time to capture information, or can the decision to audit be made retroactively? I’ve clicked in there a few times “by mistake” so I’m pretty sure they’re not being notified of my actions. But it’s a different story if they one day want to review the history. Is there any way to tell if auditing is “turned on”?

2- What kind of information is captured? Opening an unread email must count as an “event”, as would then marking it unread. What about an already opened one? Or sent mail? What about things typed into the search bar? You don’t have to press enter to search either, it just filters for whatever is currently filled in. Would it be capturing every keystroke? It can’t possibly do this in my normal email could it? The number of searches would be tremendous. And I observe it only auto populates searches where I have hit enter.

3- Is there a way to circumvent it? Open the mailbox (which I’ve done several times, so not concerned about this getting me in trouble) and then go offline after its populated the emails? Restart the app/computer before going back online? Make any difference?

And I’m sure they could tear the pc apart if they really wanted answers, but that’s just not a realistic concern here. I need to cover my tracks “just enough”. In all likelihood they’ll never be tipped off to it by my doing something, but there’s a slim chance settings are reviewed, maybe once in a blue moon, and they wonder if anything was ever accessed. I just want the security of baffling that first, laziest, audit. Because I think they’ll drop it at that point.

Got a $150 safety shoe rebate

The job is physically taxing. Lifting heavy shit, working 10-11 hour shifts for 5 hours a week (depends on location, my warehouse was busy)
The application process is quite long, with hours of on-boarding videos
You’ll be ignored for 2-4 weeks until they accept/reject you, this was the case for me and many others i heard from

I share a lease with someone who decided to move  with only 8 months left. They are still on the lease and could not get out of it. There’s no way I can afford everything by myself, or else I wouldn’t have ever got someone to split the lease with. While we are on the lease together, they are not split up. Therefore, the management doesn’t care who does or doesn’t pay it, as long as it gets paid. If it is not paid, then both of us are screwed. If I somehow pay it, then we both are fine.  

At first, I was taking the hit like an adult and dipped into my savings. Now, I am becoming too stressed and extremely resentful. While this person got out of it because they knew I wouldn’t let it get out of hand, they’re living their best life, not worrying about anything and does not offer to help at all. Don’t I have a right to be pissed? They didn’t fulfil their part of the contract, so why do I have to deal with it? 

Anyway, how or what can I do to screw this person over by them not paying the lease. If it doesn’t get paid, I become homeless and we both have a small ding on our rental/credit history. So I lose in that situation. Maybe I don’t pay the last month or any extra charges? Still, I also get hit for this.

A lot of these solutions are either inconvenient or blocked by IT. I will provide a simple script that might be easier for some people.

This only works if you have access to PowerShell on your work computer. If you can login to your work Teams account on a personal computer, you can also run the script there.

Copy and paste this into PowerShell and press enter:

    Clear-Host
    $WShell = New-Object -com ""Wscript.Shell""
    while($true){
    $WShell.sendkeys(""{SCROLLLOCK}"")
    Start-Sleep -Milliseconds 100
    $WShell.sendkeys(""{SCROLLLOCK}"")
    Start-Sleep -Seconds 240
    }

That's it. All the script does is toggle scroll lock on and then back off every 4 minutes. **Press Ctrl+C to end**.

**Bonus:** Now, if you want to make it even easier on yourself, instead copy the above code into Notepad and save it in a folder somewhere with a .ps1 extension. **Make sure you change the ""Save as type:"" to ""All files""**. E.g. *ToggleScrollLock.ps1*

The problem now is that Windows can't run PowerShell scripts by default, but we can make a batch file that calls the script and runs it. Now take this script:

    @ECHO OFF
    PowerShell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command ""&amp; '%~dpn0.ps1'""
    PAUSE

She was managing a massive green house for a local grocer and was thriving. She loved this job but her boss, the owner of the local store, was badly harassing her. She’s a very blunt person and laid down her boundaries early on. I overheard her on the phone multiple times putting him in his place. 

However, he never got it through his dense fucking skull and she started to see him driving her neighborhood. As a 25 year old female living alone in a new city, this was terrifying. 

It got to the point after 6 months of employment where she had to pack up her dog and some clothes in the middle of the night and left for Texas where she grew up and where her parents still live. 

She went back to Augusta with her dad and a trailer to get her furniture and while she was there she filed a police report against him so that she could have proof and get out of her lease. 

Fast forward 2 months, all of his other employees have quit because of being treated poorly and being underpaid. Yesterday she got served with a lawsuit from him for defamation. All she did was post in a local Facebook plant page about unethical business practices at this company (underpayment, being overworked, getting screamed/ cussed at by the owner daily) warning people not to work there.

She lives hours away in Texas now but I live two hours from Augusta.

She is a little younger than him, says how much she would like to party and go out, but her boyfriend doesnt want to do these things anymore. In addition, she avoids any social connection or friendships because she ""has someone at home and everyone just wants to hurt her,"" which is really not true and she knows it. 

On the other hand is her boyfriend. Who says things like ""I'm not going to leave my girlfriend because I'm too lazy to date anyone"".

But is constantly annoyed at how not independent his girlfriend is and how much she brags about things she supposedly can do. 

Now they want to get a dog and I'm sure that is just a consumer good, something from which they want to generate fun, but can not take care of it. They do not make a lot of money.

UnethicalLifeProTips,/r/UnethicalLifeProTips/comments/r58oab/ulpt_request_a_return_whenever_you_buy_something/,"It's often more expensive for companies to deal with returns for some products than to just let you keep them, or they just don't want them back for sanitary reasons (skincare, makeup, swimwear, underwear, etc). 

So, you get your money back and get to keep whatever you want. 

If they don't tell you to keep it, either just keep it since you paid for it, or return it if you only wanted it if it was free.

You'll always want to find places with free returns -- so you don't have to pay anything upfront, and it's more likely they'll let you keep it since they'd have to pay return shipping.

This usually doesn't work if you keep requesting returns every time you order from the same shop, so make sure that first order with a shop counts.  I have been told to keep swimsuits &amp; bras multiple times from a couple stores though -- good for warehouse workers who don't have to touch gross used swimsuits &amp; underwear.

A related ULPT:  Sephora, Ulta, and some other shops don't let you keep stuff, but do let you return products for free after you use them, as long as you've only used half or less (and they don't measure).  So, use about half of it then return it.  If it's past the return window, just order the same product and return the old product under the new order.  They use an algorithm to deactivate accounts they don't like, but as long as you don't return huge $1000+ orders or say things were stolen, you have to be very blatant to get deactivated.

I've only done this in the USA, I'm not sure if any of this works elsewhere.

Eventually, I had to open a PayPal dispute to get the seller to respond and issue a refund for returning it. So I packaged it and sent the item back using priority shipping but for some reason it was held at US customs for about a week. During this period of time, the seller didn't bother checking the tracking information and after two weeks, US customs decided to send the item back to me. I then received an email from my postal service to inform me about the status of the parcel and I immediately raised the issue with the seller and advised him to call the US Customs and DHL to see if he can intercept the parcel. I also helped checked with my postal service to ask them to hold the parcel.

&amp;#x200B;

However, we were too late and was informed that the parcel was already on its way back and I told the seller that I will mail it back to him again once I have received it. So here's the problem, I have asked the seller politely to cover the cost of the second round of shipping since it wasn't my fault that the item got held by US Customs for whatever reason. Also I think that if he had tracked the item more actively, he would definitely have noticed the issue in time and been able to check with Customs about the parcel. Instead, he refused and went on a tirade about how it's not his fault that the camera was returned and I was the one who mailed it in the first place.

As hard as you try, you just can't. It's called paruresis and I've got one solution for y'all which will disturb the ones with you on rest room.

Scenario: You are on a public well visited rest room for men and need to pee heavily. Like you're on a sports match.  Ok, too much beer, blatter filled. You hold your weewee in front of the pissoir and try to pee. You stand there with your wood exposed for 5 mins and more people are entering the ceramic jungle. Now, what you need to do is, close your eyes... breathe in and out deeply with your eyes closed (calm yourself, in any way. if you cant stand the stinky, try sth else calming) for 3 or 4 times and then try to imagine this exact rest room completely empty. This should help. If the noises are interrupting you, you'll need headphones. You'll look like a fool, meditating, heavily breathing, eyes closed -- maybe lookin like a psychopath. You may scare people off ... but there is the chance for you to pee.

If you don't have headphones, use your hands to close your ears and try freehandedly. Hope this will help many of my paruresis guys.","ULPT Guys with paruresis, there is one technique that could help you but may disturb your rest room mates."

His son legally owns 1/4 of the business, and is a friend of mine who also hates his fathers guts and works with me. The friend and his mother started the business about 2 1/2 years ago and around 1 year ago when he realized it was doing so well the father (my boss) quit his job trucking job and basically stole the business from them, even though after a year and a half he still doesn’t know shit about the business. After he came back the mother and him got into fights because he is a psychopath who accused her of cheating on him, as well as his constant mental and sometimes physical abuse, and now they are going through a divorce. So the mother who hired me left.  Now it is my boss, the son, and me. The son (my friend) used to take care of a lot of work, but since all of this happened he is extremely unmotivated to do much work for the business. So over the last 8 months I have been essentially running the business myself, for 10 dollars an hour. We gross $2500 on bad days, and I know our business expenses. I am getting heavily taken advantage of. The thing is, you must be 21 to work at my job. I am employed under the table, illegally, as I am not 21. On top of that, through my time running his business I found that he is cooking his books and taking cash profits without reporting them to avoid paying as much in tax. I know the federal government takes shit like that seriously. My goal is to either blackmail my boss for personal gain, or legally force him out of the business. How do I go about doing this the most effective way?",ULPT Question: How do I go about blackmailing my horrible boss for cooking books and illegally employing me.
UnethicalLifeProTips,/r/UnethicalLifeProTips/comments/r20jt9/ulpt_question_how_to_stop_construction_outside_my/,"So we live in an area with a few houses being built. It is normally pretty noisy during the day with all the construction going on, but I know they're all just doing they're job and almost every one is cognizant of how much noise they're making and will try to keep the really loud jobs for mid day. Every one except Dirk. Dirk is an asshole builder with no family who is clearly trying to build this house as low cost as possible and is trying to do as much of the work himself as possible. Normally I wouldn't have a problem with this, and would actually respect it, except it's resulted in him using some of the loudest equipment at the crack of dawn nearly every day for the last 2-3 months.

I've kind of gotten used to it, I just know that I'm going to be woken up at 7 AM no matter what and have adjusted my life to this fact. The issue is that we now have family visiting us (has been planned for months, long before Dirk started this construction project next door) and the noise is driving everyone bonkers. We wrongly assumed that Dirk would be taking Thanksgiving off, and that we'd be safe to stay up a bit late last night drinking, as families do when they get together for the first time in nearly a year. Nope! Sure enough, I heard his Backhoe Loader startup at 7 AM on the dot, and he's been at it for the last 2 1/2 hours with no signs of stopping anytime soon.

Unfortunately I know that he is not breaking any labor laws, he is will within his rights to do is work at this time, however I don't think that makes it right. He is ruining Thanksgiving for my family and likely the few other families who's houses are nearby. We've tried talking with him in the past (my mom even brought him some cookies the first week he started working) but we've had no luck with getting him to save the loud projects for mid-day, and it has gotten somewhat contentious in the past.

I'm currently deadset on making sure this doesn't happen tomorrow morning too. I will have one fun night with my family with everyone being able to sleep in the morning after. If anyone is familiar with Backhoe Loaders, and knows of anyway I can disable one for a period of time without doing any actual damage to it, or has any other ideas of how I can delay his construction in the morning I would be very appreciative. It doesn't need to be out the whole day, I just need to delay him by an hour or two so that we can have a normal morning not being woken up at 7 AM.

Throwaway to a avoid the tax man coming and smiting me.

TLDR: Dad died, mum has a diverse portfolio, she wants to start transferring money to me 27(m) and my sister 25(f) UK.

So my dad died in July and he was the only earner for the family. My mum was a stay at home mum and basically raised us. Although his death wasn't unexpected, he didn't really plan much and so my mum has been left to pick up the buck and try and organise his affairs. This has left her with a huge worry that if something were to happen to her we would get heavily taxed for her estate. Therefore she wants to find a way to give us money without incurring any heavy taxes if something unexpected were to happen to her.

He left my mum with a significantly diverse portfolio of several houses (2m +), a dental practice, over 400k in savings, several isas 200k +, two Porche 911 Carreras and various other assets. Additionally my grandparents died last year and left my dad with a house worth around 500k which, although it has gone to my mum, will be split between myself and my sister according to my mums wishes.

Now from what I can find, in the UK you can transfer up to £3000 and several 'small' gifts a year. Anything more than that and if the person dies within 7 years you will incur inheritance tax.

Are there any under the table ways to transfer the money without the tax man knowing?

My thoughts so far are - Mum pays for courses we can go on - such as an upcoming ski instructor course i want to do that would be circa £9k.

The problem is this is all relatively small fry compared to the overall amount of the estate.

This is a traditional high-tech company (so not a young techy startup). We have here lots of PhDs, MScs, and all very educated and polite people, or so I thought.   
My department is located in the **furthest part of the company** (far away from the CEO and such), and we have a bathroom with three stalls for 12-13 men, but with corona most of the people are WFH, so, usually, we have 4 or 5 people here.  The women have their own single bathroom and do not raise any suspicion. The bathroom, however, is used by colleagues from other departments, as it is considered to be relatively clean and in good condition. We don't usually have problems with people ""doing their deeds"" as everyone here always has been so polite and clean after themselves. Also, all the stalls being occupied is rather unlikely (given what I've seen).  


The ""tartort"" was the **first stall, closest to the door and stairs**. Someone **pissed aiming at the wall** (yes, in that area the white paint is now indeed yellow). It most probably **happened after hours** (or close to), but you will understand it is hard for me to pinpoint it. I've spoken to people that were here and no one saw it or did not pay enough attention. **It was a lot of liquid.** The idea that an old man (we have many old people) would have a blatter problem and simply exploded sounds... hm, it would certainly be very weird if that is the case. But what would not be weird in this situation, right?  


The cleaning lady said it had **happened once before,** but not to this extent (the wall was indeed white before). This was about two weeks ago. Or was it two months? To be honest, I don't remember exactly what she said (I am an ex-pat and not completely fluent in their language).  


Now, my dearest community of people I would never completely trust, I ask your help:  


* Which information am I lacking?
* I suppose it is revenge against the company. But this would only hurt the cleaning person. I understand we here are a bunch of nerds that would be too afraid to do something ""real"", but I expect the criminal to at least plan his action.

UnethicalLifeProTips,/r/UnethicalLifeProTips/comments/qwyqwa/ulpt_how_to_be_a_good_liar/,"This is probably a horrible life tip, but I might as well share how everyone I always worked with thought I was a truthful Mary who couldn't tell a lie even if I tried.


This is how I have always gotten away with things at work... (especially like not having to send doctor notes for calling in sick)

I intentionally get caught in small lies, the most harmless the better. Usually with co-workers more than management. 

Example would be

Co-worker: Hey Connie did you file that paperwork before the deadline?

Me: Ugh, yeah sure.

And be completely obvious you are lying, really play up the bad lying thing. Make the co-worker sus and confront you right then and there or investigate it and confront you later. Preferably with an audience.

When confronted immediately give in and act very humble and embarrassed. Apologize that you lied, you turned in the paperwork right at the deadline you caught up with other things and was afraid to let people down. Usually, the co-worker feels all high and proud they were smart enough to catch someone in a lie. They want to mention it like 80% of the time ""Yeah, well no offense you are a really bad liar"" and then admit yourself that yeah, you are a really bad liar. Act ashamed of it.

I admit casually and not very often throughout conversation that I'm a bad liar as well. Like a joke on myself more than trying to convince people.


So when I need to actually lie about something important. Wether I'm a good liar or a bad liar. The people around me already believe they know my ""tells"" from when I played it up before and then believe you are telling the truth. 

Works a lot for me. I love it when people think I'm a bad liar! I don't lie often, but setting this up for myself has really saved myself in a pinch.

It's not fool proof but it's a useful safety net.",ULPT: How to be a good liar

My normally very-docile and sweet SO is extremely hypersensitive to tobacco odor to the point of feeling ill and wants to fistfight someone at this point.

We know for sure it’s next door because we talked to the downstairs neighbors who have confirmed it’s not them. Talking to next door neighbors is not an option because we’ve had other problems before (eg them being mad we had a guest park over when they take more than their allotted spaces and we have had one shared car between us for most of our time living here) but when we tried bringing these up to them civilly we get shit down and told to mind our own business. They get really rude about it and go out of their way to be dicks to us for a while after. Also, we can’t just go talk to a landlord or anything because a family member owns our condo independently and theirs is owned by someone else. Whether it goes against their lease terms is not technically our business. 

What I’m looking for is a way to annoy them that counts as “minding our own business.” Maybe something foul-smelling to go through the vents and get back at them? So if they bring it up to us we can pull the “if what you smell from our apartment is your business then right back at you.” Open to other ideas too. There’s a few requirements though.

* Nothing permanent or hard to get rid of. We do still rent and the fam plans on selling our place early next year. (this also means burning bridges is kind of ok if it comes down to that since our days here are numbered but we do kind of fear retaliation, eg having our vehicles fucked with)

* No fire hazards.

* Ideally something where there’s some plausible deniability that we’re doing it on purpose?

The largest Facebook community page for my town is controlled by far right admins. They've done a good job of pretending to be a moderate and non political page, but they are far from it.

They allow right wing news stories to be posted, but nothing moderate or left, they allow their biases through, while deleting anything that challenges it. They pretend to delete anything political, but far right news stories stay up for days (only to be deleted once the conversation has died), but anything that doesn't fit their bias is gone immediately. It has even gotten to the point where people living in the community were confused and unaware of certain events because the admins hid it. This had a huge impact in the recent school board election because they allowed their candidates to post their political stuff but no one else could, and they wouldn't even allow the ""meet the candidates"" night posts, so many people didn't know about it. When people call this page out, the admins block them and delete the posts, then gaslight to say they were posting hateful comments or whatever.

Anyway, all of this to say that the page isn't exactly breaking rules, so Facebook won't take it down on its own. Is there a way to get report it enough on the few instances they do break rules to get the community shut down. I know making fake accounts may help, but not sure if it'll be enough.

I can’t just ‘turn it on’ and leave it running without wearing it because the system can sense that and will report it at best as a leaky mask and at worst as me just not wearing it properly.

Furthermore, the main reason that most people dont declare bankruptcy is because it affects your credit rating making it difficult to purchase a house, but the reality of it is that most of us cannot buy a house even with good credit.

Therefore, the smart move is to take as much items on credit as possible. Pay the absolute minimum on every credit account you have until you have taken as much credit as possible from the system &amp; then declare bankruptcy based on an inability to pay your debts.

Someone just rear ended me at a red light and is now claiming she never hit me with her insurance.

My car, which I’m trying to sell, has now depreciated in value because of this cow. Legal recourse is too much of a pain in the ass and will cost money and time.

1. After finding which controller you would like, actually buy it but say that you want the protection plan on it. It might be over $5, but usually is never more than $10. These are for the average $50-60 controller

2. If your controller starts to act up, or even somehow breaks a little, take it in for a replacement. This replacement, with the plan, will be free. 

3. Here's how this guaranteed $5 controller becomes crucial. Once you get your replacement, request a new protection plan. 

Congratulations! You've just technically bought a replacement for less than $10, and now can do the same thing whenever you want.

As has become typical with the release of these games, a bunch of different food items are bearing promo codes for in game unlocks. Some of these codes are easy enough to steal, like the ones on Dorito or Pizza Roll bags which are printed on the outside of the bag. Just snap a picture and move on with your day. However, some of these are more elusive. In particular, cans of Rockstar energy drink have codes for skins and double XP in the upcoming Halo game which are hidden beneath the tab. Typically, you would have to open the can to see them. I'm wondering if anybody has devised a method of retrieving these codes that doesn't involve breaking the seal on the can. I experimented with a can I purchased for myself to see if I could use pliers to bend the tab up, see the code, and then just flatten the tab back down. This failed, however, as the tabs are highly resistant to bending, and the seal would break before the tab would bend. Maybe I would have better luck trying from a different angle as I was trying to ""roll"" the tab up. Perhaps being more vertical with my approach and going for a sharp bend would work better. Either way, if anyone has any suggestions, I'd love to hear them. My biggest condition is that the can needs to stay sealed.",ULPT Request: How To Get Codes From Underneath The Tabs Of Energy Drinks Without Purchasing Them

it isn't super thin, its like a credit card and it is not flimsy, it feels like if i bend it i can definitely snap in 2 without bending much.

When i take out the card, after a few seconds i hear the same click, this time i assume the fusebox turns off since lights go out at the same time.

Step 2: Make sure you have the women sign a contract beforehand that gives you complete ownership of the porn and allows you to choose whether to publish / sell the porn or to let it rot in your basement.

Step 3: Proceed not to make any profits with the porn, so that you don´t have to pay them anything.

Any holes in this plan?

Step 1 - Grow credit limits to 300 to 500k across many credit cards. This can be done in less than 10 years if you frequent credit forums and make decent money.

Step 2 - Buy a home while my credit is still good but ensure that I never pay the equity down to less than 80% (bankruptcy protection amount)

Step 3 - Max out credit cards buying something that can be converted back to cash. Pay the minimum for at least 3 months 90 days, maybe a bit longer. This step is where people try to scare you saying you can't do this. The reality is you can wait years to file bankruptcy before getting sued and no one is in a rush to file bankruptcy after maxing out credit cards. As long as you wait 90 + days after making big purchases, it falls out of the fraud realm generally speaking. I would wait at least a year before filing bankruptcy knowing the longer I wait, the better. Realistically you could wait years before being sued.

Step 4 - If the bankruptcy is approved, liquidate purchased assets and pay off the home or stash cash in something else.

Step 5 - Follow the bankruptcy credit repair plan and have a 700+ credit score in less than 2 years thereby mitigating damage and making the risk worth the reward.",ULPT : Max out credit cards and file for bankruptcy 90+ days later

Do you ever get to that stage at the dinner party where you can just see that the other people are vying to know what you do for a living?

But you don't really want to tell them because you hate being defined by what you do professionally and you can sense that they're just gunning to see if it's something important enough that they could ""use"" you some way professionally?

Do you feel like your dinner party guests would probably look down on what you do professionally if they found out? You're surrounded by lawyers and you work in marketing?

Fear no more.  I've been there and back and got the shirt. Better yet, I have a solution. Tell them that're a data entry technician.

Why a data entry technician specifically?

1: It's professional while sounding like just about the lowest level professional job imaginable. If you tell snooty people that you're a janitor or bus driver they immediately get into defensive posturing and assert how valuable those jobs are to society. By telling them that you're a data entry technician, you can watch as a three second moment of awkwardness unfolds as people prepare to muster up an adequate response.

2: If you say that you're a ""data entry technician"" people in tech will immediately wonder whether you actually work in data science and perk up with interest, at which point you can assert that no, you just do manual data entry and enter text into spreadsheets. Then you can observe for another few seconds as the manufactured awkwardness returns.

3: There is literally nothing to ask or say back to this. Nobody has ever asked me what kind of data I enter into computers. Typically people will smile awkwardly for a few seconds, throw a quick pitiful glance across the table, before moving on.

Basically, if you don't feel the need to divulge what you do to judgmental people you're socializing with, tell them that you're a data entry technician. It's a quick out and you'll get to spectate some great social awkwardness.","ULPT: To immediately end conversations about what you do professionally, say that you're a data entry technician"

I would appreciate some input to get this particular fellow on his nerves. He's a psycho narcissist who has been harassing me for three weeks with death threats, making up all sorts of slander, threatening me to sue and blame me for his girlfriend's non-existent STD and drug use, etc. —he's basically jealous because they are in a supposedly 'open' relationship, but when he found out about me, he humiliated her and took the piss on both of us.

I just want to push him subtly over the edge so he'll show his true colors to everyone , and the way it'll hurt him the most: he's a 40 year old narcissist womanizer who's used to manipulate young girls (his GF is 23). I know he can't stand that he can't **control** her (being in another country and socially close to me); he can't stand being **humiliated** by a 'sexual contender'; his **reputation** as a sensitive academic is everything to him (he's a covert psychopath, and so far nobody has denounced him), etc.

I was thinking about sending him subtle reminders of his lack of control, making him insecure, or afraid of being exposed as the piece of shit he is, etc. This without direct incrimination or making it obvious that it was me. And without putting her in risk, of course (I can't talk to her, because he has painted me the 'bad' guy).

Flooding his mail inbox with specific websites is one idea, or with SMS might be another. But I can't find any trusty sites that I can use for these (especially for SMSs, given that he's in South America).

So, I’m working from home and decided to sleep during my hour break! Problem is, I was so exhausted that I slept for 3 hours by accident.

The work has a very precise punch in punch out system, so they know very well that i wasn’t working. 

Now i’m looking for an excuse, i’m not sure what to say. 

My best option right now is just being honest, telling them I overslept due to the exhausting mid-term week. I’m scared that this won’t be a good enough excuse.

I thought about maybe saying I passed out, but the problem is i punched back in and someone that passes out usually goes to the hospital instead of back to work when they wake up!

My last excuse would be saying my cat ran away, or a dog i was babysitting!

For better or worse, I'm the sysadmin at home. I have full admin rights on all computers, router is in my bedroom, etc. However, I am also ~~called on~~ obliged to fix things whenever they go wrong...

1. Asking him to stop. Result: screamed multi-hour lecture about reptilians, flat earth, vaccines, nanomachines, etc. ending with ""If you don't like it, get out of my house"".
2. Setting ffmpeg to play radio static in the background, so that all sound output is annoying. Result: I had to fix it. He still believes it was technical problems.
3. Throttling his internet speed using NetBalancer, so that the multi-hour video podcasts lag. Result: Makes no difference. I can't block his internet completely, or he'll just insist on getting a new PC. 
4. HOSTS and router-level blocking. Result: Doesn't work, due to alternate addresses, and too many sites (I tried subscribing to a blocklist via HostsMan, but that wasn't very effective) and our router is locked down by ISP (no custom firmware).
5. Misc. computer problems, fake viruses, all easily fixable by running ```ping``` and ```dir``` a couple times ;). Result: unsuitable for long-term use, doesn't stop him from broadcasting.
6. Make quiet, annoying autism-tic noises for a little while. Result: He complained about it and kept telling me to be quiet. Oh, the irony. Annoyed him, but doesn't affect his listening/broadcasting habits.

**Things I'm going to do:**

1. Get the hell outta here as soon as I find work. Struggling at the moment, as I haven't finished my degree and also want to leave the country. I'm working on it.
2. Possibly set up his PC for remote shutdown? And randomly do that?
3. Possibly engage in a war of sound: find some music that I can tolerate and he hates, and play it very loudly as long as he listens? Probably just force me to stop, though. Also gonna be difficult, as both him and I have eclectic music tastes. He used to think Queen were devil-worshippers, but now likes their music since used in his podcasts. Weirdest that I like is [Mongolian heavy metal/kargyraa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4xZUr0BEfE), [JOJO soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4apTqsfNbk), [Rammstein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeQM1c-XCDc), but he'll just end up liking them, and I can only take so much.

She continued the rubbing and even went directly in-between my legs while her police was pressed into my head and rubbed right next to my butthole and grazing my cock on her way down. This continued and she eventually told me to turn over.

Now there was a strong communication barrier, after  she began to lightly run her fingers across my chest and thighs as I lay there with my eyes closed.

Her energy was also lower and she just seemed off. I had my suspicions but brushed it off and just continued to watch her behavior. 

However, last Wednesday my suspicion grew a lot stronger when I came in with my dog and I went to the bathroom. When I was in the bathroom I heard her whimper/whine which is unusual. I thought she may be hurt or just wanting something like food but I came out and my roommate was with her in the hallway. She was sitting and he was petting her. Seems normal but this man has NEVER pet my dog and shoos her off and corrects her just when she is greeting him. So it seemed like he was a deer caught in headlights. My suspicions were much stronger and I continued to watch her behavior. When he corrects her when I’m around, her tail is tucked and she goes to hide or lay in her bed.

Now checking for blacklisted phone it doesn’t say it’s black listed.

What should I do with phone,, continue to use it or report to apple and surrender it to them.

UnethicalLifeProTips,/r/UnethicalLifeProTips/comments/qdwmlx/ulpt_how_to_fill_employment_gaps/,"So you got laid off during COVID and didn't work for awhile. Maybe you had to take care of a family member who was sick, or you were worried about your safety during these crazy times. Maybe you just needed some extended time off for your mental health. Well like it or not HR doesn't like to see gaps on your employment history. 

These are the tricks I've used to fill employment gaps over the years. 

Change the timeframes of your past jobs by a month of two to reduce the gap(s). Even if they find out they probably won't care much. 

Say you started your own business and it didn't work out. This one is the most impressive to employers but takes the most confidence from you. I actually have attempted a few businesses so when I use this one it's just me changing the timeframes. Your business idea can be anything. It obviously didn't work out/can't sustain you yet, so it doesn't have to be some amazing idea. Here are a few that I tried, drop shipping, affiliate marketing, freelancing, day trading, real estate, etc. If you have a hobby you can say you tried to turn it into a business. Most employers will maybe ask one question about it. Just be humble as to not give the impression you don't need the job. Its almost impossible for employers to disprove this one as well.

Say you had a job working at ""insert closed business here"". The business is closed so it's hard for them to check. Unless they're very thorough with their background check they'll just take your word for it. Probably a good idea not to imbelish too much so they don't dig into it.

Lastly say you were taking care of a sick loved one. I've never used this but I know people who have with great success. A bonus is that if they probe, you can say it's personal and you don't want to go into details. Also impossible to disprove. 

Also one thing to keep in mind is a lot of business won't check your job history very thoroughly, especially for entry level stuff. Certain industries do tend to check, but many dont. Another thing is that it's a numbers game. If you spam applications at least one company will be lazy and just take your word. I've had to learn the hard way that lying a little bit can go a long way towards landing you a job sometimes.

So, this month when I saw full charge again, I went there for them to say - well we have a paper with your signature on it and will not refund or alter the charge. And from that point onwards, I remembered their unhelpful behavior even before that; and internet scouring showed me how big of an asshat the company really is.

But for now, they only handed out referral codes to old and active members. If you sign in with my referral links in the below, you and I will earn $100 in DeSo currency after you complete the KYC (Know Your Customer) steps successfully. They use Jumio's automated system for KYC and you will be verified in 5 minutes. (Unfortunately they didn't include some countries, Russia, India, Turkey etc.) (You can try KYC again if robot check fails) After that you can withdraw that 1 DeSo at exchange blockchain  
.com or Ascendex exchange. I know it sounds like an offer too good to be true, but it's real and This is not exactly unethical but **you can make it unethical** with signing up with your other ID's at different devices :) ( for example you can sign in with your national ID than you can sign in with driver's license at another device with different internet IP. Jumio's system unable to detect the same person.)  But I hope those who really need it take advantage of it because it is literally free money with almost no effort.

I have turned on ""family"" mail forwarding from the old address to my mother's retirement home (i.e. will catch any mail addressed to anyone with our family name) and this forwarding will last for a year.

I also turned on ""USPS Informed Delivery"" which means, I get emailed an image of her envelopes before they are delivered to her. This is helpful because after a few months, I noticed her financial statements were being sent to the old house and were getting forwarded by the USPS. I knew that once the forwarding expires, she would very likely lose control over her accounts. She is old.

So, I did what any reasonable son would do: wrote anonymous letters to each bank, asking them to update her address and to telephone her for verification of this. Amazingly, two of the banks did update right away (they were had Forwarding Notification Requested service, which means the USPS was verifying to them the address change).

Also, I live with a cat but he's never urinated outside of his box (amazing) and even when I'm taking that cat out for a walk, he'd never pee outside.

Today, one of my neighbors came to my flat and he was furious. He covered the camera and kept smashing at the door until I opened. Than he said that he knows that I let my cat outside to pee at his property (bs, see above) and that he needs to take an action.

the weakness is primarily in my legs, almost equal on both sides, as well as common in my neck which means i have trouble holding my head up. my arms are far better than the rest of my body. the cane was useful when it was only on one side, but does very little for me now. the rollator puts far too much strain on my back and causes pain in my legs, but gives me a place to sit which is very important

all of this is to say that a wheelchair is the ideal mobility aid for me, as it allows me to build up strength in my arms, provides a place to sit, may support my neck {depending on the model}, and would greatly reduce leg pain. yes, i've used a wheelchair before, yes, it's beneficial for me

my biggest problem is that my parents tell me that they don't want me to ""give up"" on my legs. i don't know how to express to them the pain that i'm in just from getting around or standing. i don't know how to express to them how difficult it is to get around. i need some way to convince them to allow me the aid that i need

i apologize if this sounds like a bratty complaint from a lazy teenager. i'm 17 and i plan to move out of province next September for uni, and while i could likely get a wheelchair at that point, i'm in constant pain now and it makes it difficult to see that far ahead. all i can think of is how much i hurt. also, let me know if things need rewording or more clarification, i did not sleep last night and can't tell if my wording is good or not because of it",ULPT Request: i need a wheelchair. my parents are against me getting one

I'm currently finishing up a PharmD degree. The last 2 semesters of school are purely experiential, where you complete 6-week long rotation blocks at different hospital, industry, and retail settings. There are 7 blocks, and you get 1 ""off-block"". For whatever reason, we can't choose which block we have off, UNLESS we have a significant life event going on, and NEED that specific block off.

Today, I was chatting about rotation site details with the rotation coordinator, who handles all of the nitty gritties. She asked which block I wanted to have off, to which I told her block 7. She said ""We usually don't give off block 7, any specific reason you need it off?""

Now, I had originally planned on making up some bullshit excuse as to why I needed this block off, however, I hadn't anticipated it coming up in conversation weeks before the actual site selections occurred. I got flustered, and told her I was officiating my buddies wedding. Which is true, of course, but it's happening this weekend, NOT during block 7.

She says ""alright no problem, just send me the save-the-date and we can work something out.""

So as of now, I'm trying to figure out how to create a fake save-the-date without actually paying for one.

I can't tolerate the dinosaur family above me any longer. They have 4 obnoxious children that scream and run around shaking my lights from 7 a.m. to 1 a.m. **everyday**.

I don't want to move, as my lease is a year, I love the location I'm in, and I'm currently not in the financial position to afford a move.

The landlord bluntly told me he won't evict them for noise. The fucking kids even do water damage to the floor, and every 3 months the landlord has to come into **my*, apartment to change the tiles in the bathroom since the kids get so much water on the floor. Yet he won't evict them for that either. So doing something like setting crayons outside to bait them drawing on the walls won't do shit. 

The father of the kids bluntly told me, ""We're loud and we're not gonna change. It's in our culture to be loud.""

Well fine then. You obviously lack empathy, so I'm going to lack empathy for you guys by breaking up your relationship. 

Since the landlord won't evict them, this is the kind of situation where you have to destroy it from the inside out. 

I've spent a good few hours reading this sub and utilizing the search for ideas. Based on past thread ideas, I'm trying to put up a game plan, but I still need help. 

A large problem is the way this house is set up. Another problem is that I have 3 cats that I don't want to upset. 

**There's 1 door to the house. You enter a hallway. There's the door to my apartment, then stairs that go up to their apartment.**

This is significant because I can't get away with things like sliding piss under the door or putting fish somewhere nasty as it would affect the smell in my own apartment too. 

My desire is to utilize the subwoofer method that I often see talked about. However, I'm pretty sure playing 10hz **will** also hurt my cats. I will not do anything to harm them. I also would have no idea how to modify a speaker. 

Next, is that **it's extremely important I don't make myself a target or suspected.** As I'm mostly alone here and I'm a 125lb woman with *both* a physical and visual disability that makes me accident prone. **I don't want to put myself or my cats in danger** as the baby daddy is a big man. 

For destroying their relationship, so far I've come up with mailing a professional looking letter of STD results, making a logo and all. 

I'm not sure if I should target the mom or dad yet as the cheating one.

 I haven't been here long, and I don't know if they are actually married or not. I'm hoping they are, because that would open an opportunity for joint custody. 

If they aren't, then it's most likely one will just leave and I'll still be stuck with the crotch goblins. 

**That's why I want to ruin things so much for them, that they don't end up staying here. **

Next, maybe in a couple weeks after the letter, place a condom 
(wrapped/unopened) outside their door under their coat rack in hopes one will see it. I want it to appear like it accidentally fell out of a pocket... But this one has a chance of backfiring too. 

When the one denies anything, I risk them coming downstairs and figuring out I did it with something along the lines of, ""You trying to fuck with us!!?"" But I'm not sure if they would be smart enough to figure that out. 

Then from there??? Where do I go? 

I've contemplated hiring someone off Craigslist to show up, but (1) I can't really trust someone 100% to not tell since the dad sees like the type to pull a gun. And (2) I'm shit with stuff like VPN. 

Planting weed is also wouldn't work, as it's legal where I am.

I recently purchased a Nintendo Switch that was in ""brand new"" condition. However, upon examining the exterior of the box as well as the packaging inside the box, I think it is plausible that this Nintendo Switch was not ""brand new"". I can't know for certain as Nintendo does not factory seal the box of the Nintendo Switch or any of the packaging inside.

Anyway, the seller provided no tracking of the item. In addition, the seller is new to eBay and does not have any reviews yet.

I frequently buy items on eBay and I've only received positive reviews. I have never returned a single product. In addition, I have around CA$1300 in sales (all successful transactions, no complaints or returns).

Please correct me if I'm wrong, but considering I have a higher status on eBay compared to a new user/seller with no reviews, as well as the fact that the seller provided no tracking, do you think I could just open up a dispute with eBay saying I never received the product, and then win the dispute without question?

I know this sounds like an extremely shitty thing to do but I feel like the seller lied about the condition of the product and I don't want to go through the trouble of making a return.

1. Forgot password for whatever reason. Went to account recovery for forgotten password. It send the verification to current phone number. Because they use Apple for password management, Apple suggested a strong password. The issue is, for whatever reason, Apple didn't save said password.
2. Tried to go through Account Recovery again to reset again. Except now, it's using an OLD phone number which isn't in service anymore. No matter what we try, the current phone number won't show up as an option, as it did in bullet 1.
3. Got to the screen which has Security Questions, except the screen is blank. No security questions show up to answer.
4. It keeps telling him he's logged into a device, but he's checked every iPad, phone, TV, device, everything he can think of to figure out where it's logged in. Nothing.
5. Called Google Support, and they said they can't help. Basically prior to COVID they had a service center for these things but that doesn't exist anymore. Nothing they can do.

Are there any options here, unethical or otherwise? Since everything uses multifactor authentication, all those go to his Gmail with the verification codes, so he can't get into his banks, accounts, nothing.

UnethicalLifeProTips,/r/UnethicalLifeProTips/comments/q5qidt/ulpt_how_can_i_get_fired_while_keeping_my_buddy/,"So for a long time, I was looking for an entry-level job. One of my  life-long buddies (known them since 1st grade) got me a full-time M-F,  9-5 job because he's actually earned his way pretty far up in the  company (Branch manager for \~5 locations). 

&amp;#x200B;

Thing is, I really didn't know what this job completely entailed before I went for it (I knew what the company did, but not what I would be doing exactly). My buddy just told me ""Hey, one of my coworkers needs some help in their location-- I could get you a job."" I was in need of money for rent-- not exactly desperate, but I still went for it. Got hired right off  the bat thanks to my buddy, although it seemed the location I applied to was accepting LITERALLY ANYONE at the time.... after I started working, my now-boss would tell me stories about how they worked alone for MONTHS and how no-one ever really applied for the job... (jeez, I wonder why?) 

&amp;#x200B;

Turns  out, the job really sucks. Within my 90-day probationary period, my only other coworker (my boss/manager) was gone for a week and a half. They have now told me they will be gone for another TWO WEEKS (still within 90 days probationary) to cover another location and I really can't handle the stress of holding down our location all by myself. I've been taught enough to help out, but nowhere near enough to handle our location for 2+ weeks, let alone the week and a half I already did (once my boss/manager came back, there were MANY mistakes to fix). Thing is, the TWO WEEKS my manager/boss is covering now... is for my buddy who is going on a vacation + work trip (consecutive 2 weeks).

&amp;#x200B;

Aside, my now-boss would always tell me how the previous guy which I replaced totally sucked at his job, and that they haven't gotten really any applications ever since the COVID restrictions lifted for the company... (6 months before I was hired). The company also went into bankruptcy as soon as COVID restrictions began. I just happened to be the 2nd person hired after they re-opened. Only one guy before me, who apparently sucked at his job, and I just happened to be referred by my buddy.

&amp;#x200B;

I only have one unit and live in another city (job moved and I decided to keep the house and buy an extremely cheap fixer upper in the new town.) 

He currently has no source of income as he is moving from another country. He does, however planning to get a job. Also apparently he gets a pension of sorts of $2400 a month (my rent is 1750) 

Now the catch is that he wants a discount for paying it all up front which I understand. He would like a roughly 9% discount of $150/ month to pay it all at once. 

I have almost 50% equity in this rental house and can totally afford this. The roughly 20k in cash would also allow me to pay off almost the entire the house Im currently living in to where Ill have 85%Ish equity in the current house im living in... 

I was considering asking to double the security deposit to two months. &gt;&gt;&gt; This way just in case he is a terrible tenant and/or he no longer pays after year 1 then I have at least 2 months rent to put towards repairs and etc.

UnethicalLifeProTips,/r/UnethicalLifeProTips/comments/q4nnb5/ulpt_request_how_to_stop_speederscutthrough/,"Hey all, so I live in a neighborhood that occupies a corner of two roads that intersect. There has always been an opportunity for people to cut-through, but no good reason until a new multi-use development was built across the northern-bordering road. This new development installed an ingress/egress point directly across from our existing (northern) neighborhood entrance/exit. Previously, there wasn't enough traffic to ever cause a delay at the appropriate intersection, and there really isn't that much more congestion now (road has been widened), it's just more inconsiderate people in a rush. There have always been many walkers/runners/bikers in our neighborhood because it's all large lots and my kids and I now regularly have to get off the road when a car decides to speed by; we bike the 'loop' daily with our dog. 

&amp;#x200B;

See map: [https://www.vidble.com/show/wzQPY8X7UC](https://www.vidble.com/show/wzQPY8X7UC)

&amp;#x200B;

The residents and patrons of this development *should* exit onto the main road, head east towards the established (and improved!) intersection, and then make a right turn onto the main road that heads south into town. 

&amp;#x200B;

This (now 4-way) intersection offers folks leaving their apartments or one of two popular food/coffee joints the opportunity to simply drive straight across the road, into our neighborhood, and with only two intersections to roll through, exit onto a main road to head south towards town. It circumvents an intersection that really isn't that bad, but people don't like to be inconvenienced; I get it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Okay so now that I've laid out the physical arrangement of this issue, I need some ideas on how to stop speeders. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have priced out 'bolt-in' speed bumps, but they are $400 each, so $800 to span the width of the road, and we'd need three to four to keep speeds low enough. 

&amp;#x200B;

We've hypothesized getting a used speed-trap radar unit and installing it, maybe with a flash bulb that goes off if a car passes over 25mph, and an accompanying sign indicating speeders will be reported to police. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've thought of purchasing signs that say, ""Dead End"" or ""No Outlet"" and installing them at the northern entrance to the neighborhood with the permission of the property owner. 

&amp;#x200B;

We don't wish to break any laws, nor to inflame tensions with habitual cut-through-ers, causing their behavior to get even more egregious, but I'm sure there are creative ways to disincentivize (sp?) speeders/cut-through-ers. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I look to you fine folks in r/unethicallifeprotips for your creativity and passion for solving problems in the 'grey areas' of life.

Whatever you do for a living; baristas, IT folks, retail clerks, exevutive assistants, etc pretty much all have a certain amount of access to something, be it coffee beans, old hardware, whatever. You get where I'm going with it.

First off, I don't own a car and I live somewhere where these sort of things are dealt with in a much less civilzed manner but y'all probably won't take this seriously anyway.
I saw a video on the front page of a girl that rear-ended an expensive car and tried to pass the blame on the other driver. That is obviously a bad move especially with dash cam ect. Now the better thing to do here would be to come clean, at the very least it won't escalate the situation....

Hi,

So our company is getting merged with / acquired by another company. For the third time. In two years. That means another round of systems changes, another round of leadership shuffling, another round of needless meetings to introduce our product offering to some faceless bozo overseas and a whole trash heap of useless meetings about 'positioning' and 'values' etc.

I'm sick and tired of corporate shenanigans having a hold over my life and I have made a decision: I'm getting out. Based on the decisions made over the past couple of years, it's become clear that the company clearly no longer gives a fuck about me, so it's time to stop giving a fuck about them.

**Here's the challenge:** I want to buy a home. And the easiest way by far to get a mortgage is to have a paycheck. Since buying a home is easily a 3-6 month process, that means I gotta hang in there for a while longer. As for how I'm going to pay my mortgage later, this is easy; I have plenty contract opportunities and already have a small side business where I do freelance work.

**So here's what I want to do:** do the bare minimum at work, whilst I build up my contracting business behind the scenes.

**Factors in my favour:**

* My skill set is in demand. Not bragging here, I get job offers on the regular. In fact, I have a pretty chill 3 day/wk contracting offer on the table right now that would easily pay my bills.
* I'm not really driven by money. As long as I make enough to pay the rent / mortgage and put some aside in a nest egg, I'm good.
* I'm not burdened by career ambition. I' m perfectly happy being mediocre.
* My partner is a high income earner and we don't want kids, so risk is something we can afford
* **I have 9 weeks of payable long service leave**. This is an Australian thing. I got it as a result of my 11 year tenure, and it gives me a nice cushion / crash landing pad in case things go bad.
* I have 50(!!) days of untaken accrued sick leave. Not payable obviously, but I can take part of them with a reasonable excuse.
* My manager doesn't seem to give much of a fuck, as he's only recently come back from 3 weeks stress leave. If anything, I think he'd be proud of me if I can make this work.
* I work largely remote, so it's very easy for me to pretend

**Factors I have going against me:**

* Occasionally, I'm client facing. No way I can duck that work
* I have a junior reporting into me. He's a good, honest kid who shouldn't have to suffer from my apathy. I have quite a bit of sway over him, and I'm pretty sure popping his mid-20s naivete-bubble would put him in some sort of existential crisis.
* I regularly have to get my hands dirty. Mainly that's because my technical capabilities and -intuition are somewhat unique in the company.

**Ideas I have so far:**

Okay, so I want to really elevate slacking off to an art. I'm thinking I could try to get by doing \~10% effort for a couple of months. Here's some ideas I've had:

* For team meetings, use a series of looped recordings of me pretending to be at my desk using software like altercam.
* Get a cheap virtual assistant to man my outlook and Microsoft Teams
* Hire a more technical VA to do some of the more technical work I have to do
* Gradually 'train' my colleagues to expect slow response times by slowly increasing my response times on teams, email etc.

**I guess my question is:** does anybody here have experience slacking off skillfully without getting detected? can you share any dos, don'ts, and other valuable life lessons in the art of flying under the radar?",ULPT Request - How to get by doing the bare minimum at work

She bought the initial materials and I paid my half. I told her I'd keep a log of out of pocket costs related to the install and let her know the split amount when I was finished. I installed the fence which involved LOTS of manual labor, digging old posts with concrete out of ground from between two trees, renting auger, digging twenty 3ft holes using various methods, pouring concrete, etc. It was a lot of work, but materials were like 250ish, $125 for her. The labor costs would have been $2k-ish if we hired contractors so I saved her a lot of money on that. I gave her an itemized list of materials with receipts and she refused to pay her half!

It wasn't worth it to me to pursue this in small claims and I wrote it off, but I told myself it'd be better if we didn't speak or have any type of communication because there's no way I'd split anything with her again, and I no longer trusted her, so no need to speak, anything can be done in writing.

&amp;#x200B;

We recently moved halfway across the country (CA--&gt;TX), and our experience with our moving company has been an absolute nightmare. They raised our estimate by $3,000 once they showed up, delayed our delivery, then lost and broke a bunch of our stuff, including two pads from our super expensive couch. Had we known they'd mess up the couch, we literally would have sold everything we owned and not used a moving company at all.

They won't return our calls, and their customer service reps give us ""no updates"" when we call. Our insurance only pays $.60/lb, so we'll barely get a few dollars for them, but the manufacturer wants over $1,100 for the two pads. Overall, I estimate there's between $2,000 and $5,000 worth of damage (some boxes are missing and we're not sure what items were in them).

&amp;#x200B;

Nobody at the company cares about customer service, and we have no recourse against them because insurance will only pay us cents on the dollar for our stuff, so how can we effectively get our money's worth for the damage they've caused us?

Backstory: this is my mom's story, told to me recently since in New Orleans we're having our own garbage pileup following Hurricane Ida.

Back in 1968, NYC had a 9-day garbage strike. I found an [article](https://untappedcities.com/2015/02/11/today-in-nyc-history-the-great-garbage-strike-of-1968/) describing the scene: ""T*he* *New York Times* lamented that the city looked like a vast slum as mounds of refuse grow higher and strong winds whirl the filth through the streets. By that point there were about 30,000 tons of trash on the streets, a number that would grow to 100,000 tons. Vincent Cannato wrote of the Lower East Side, Garbage was piled chest-high. Egg shells, coffee grounds, milk cartons, orange rinds, and empty beer cans littered the sidewalk.""

My mom was a teen at the time, and attending Rhodes school on W.54th street. She told me that her English teacher found a way around the strike... Every day he would take the most offensive trash - the aforementioned grossest items like food scraps &amp; packaging - and put them in a box. Then, he would wrap the box in gift wrap with a big, fancy, attractive bow on it. He'd go park somewhere near school and conveniently ""forget"" to close his trunk, leaving the ""present"" vulnerable to theft. Of course, some opportunistic person would nab the gift, thinking they were getting lucky. Wish I could have seen their face! Every day he would switch up where he parked, so the locals wouldn't get wise.

And that's how he got his trash picked up during the great garbage strike of 1968! \[Contemplating doing this here in New Orleans rn...\]",ULPT Pro Tip from 1968 NYC: How To Navigate a Garbage Strike

There are ""woke"" types that believe that women can do no wrong and everything wrong with a relationship is men's fault. On the other hand, there are ""incel"" types who believe that women are the cause of everything evil and men are never at fault. Many people have agendas and do not necessarily have the best in mind for you or your relationship.

As such, the best way to receive neutral and even-handed answers is to claim that both you and your partner that are being discussed are non-binary. There is nothing an ideologue can say to push agendas, anti-male or anti-female, in this case. In such cases, people who do have agendas will not respond to you, and the ones who do respond are more likely to offer constructive discussion. I would suggest using only they/them pronouns for your posts, since neopronouns like xe/xir just make it sound like you are mocking non-binary people.

The point of this is not to disparage non-binary people and is only meant as a means to receive high quality dating advice, but I could understand how pretending to be non-binary might make it seem like I am trivializing them, some of whom are probably having relationship difficulties themselves, so I would classify this advice as kind of unethical.","ULPT: when asking about dating advice on the internet, identify both yourself and your partner in question as non-binary to receive the most even-handed answers"

Then take screenshots. You can optionally hire a lawyer but not really necessary. Go to a public prosecutor and report them with screenshots. They will listen because insulting people starts from 3 months of jail time but usually converted into monetary fine. 

Wait for months for them to do something. That thing can change between inviting them to give a statement to sending police to their home, confiscating their phones/hard drives for evidence, and bringing them to precinct to get a statement. 

Wait for months again and when prosecutor asks if you want to settle down, say yes. When the other person will hear that it is a criminal offence and settling down is the easiest option especially if they have previous problems with law.

I have an absolute dick of a professor that's given us an impossible deadline (16 hours from the time of posting this) for a project that I'm yet to finish the model for and compile into sheets. My roll number is towards the end of the class, so the jury (basically a panel of professionals that will roast my project) will judge mine towards the end of 28th September.

Problem here is that the Phd scholar under my professor is a clever guy and has given us an autocad template to follow and everything, so I'm expecting him to be presenting all the submissions to the jury (by sharing his screen) and have us explain our project. I'm expecting him to do this in an attempt to keep us from presenting our screens which would have projects that have been worked on  past the deadline. 

My professor is a dick, so I'm expecting him to ban people who haven't submitted a file on time, from the jury discussion. 

I had an idea, and thought about submitting a corrupt pdf file that i can rename but won't open on a computer, so he is forced to make me present a more updated project (basically to buy me more time but unethically)

Are there any safe sites that I can download a pdf file like this and not screw my own sytem (or my professors) over?

Brief Tl;Dr: I had to move back in with my parents because the housing market is shit where I live and my landlord raised my rent $600 a month. Kid brother is an absolute shithead and my parents refuse to disciple him. He is currently going to court for two felonies if that helps any moral quandary. 

I always have an emergency fund of cash squirreled away in my room usually to the tune of 600 dollars, sometimes more, sometimes less. Two nights ago my brother asked me to drive him to McDonald’s to eat food, and when we got there he pulled out a wad of cash to pay for it. When I saw it I asked how much it was and he couldn’t tell me, so I asked to see it. It was three new hundreds and a shitload of twenty’s, to the tune of approx. $500+. I asked him where he got it and he said it was from selling shoes. (He has done this in the past, so not completely inconceivable.) He paid for his food, and when we got home went straight to sleep. Earlier tonight it donned on me that my emergency fund was made up of exactly three crisp hundreds and multiple twenties to the tune of $600+. I looked where I hid it and lo and behold my money is nowhere to be found. I emptied out the entire dresser to be sure and it’s all gone. The kid has stolen stuff from me on the past and even slammed my head into a wall hard enough to give me a mild concussion when I called him on it. I want to avoid confrontation as best I can but I also want my godsdamned money back. What’s the best way I can go about this without him knowing? He goes to school during the days and I have my weekend during the week so I can search his room if I need to.

Google does not make any attempt to verify who has made this request, and offers absolutely no way to reverse the blurring once it has been applied. Once it's blurred, it's blurred forever. Not only that, but any future imagery from that point forward will also feature the blurring too. There is currently no way of going back.

There is nothing stopping you from selectively blurring the location of businesses that benefit from this imagery to attract customers to you instead. Alternatively, this could be a great way to fuck over a landlord who's just made off with your security deposit for that pinhole in the drywall. This can also present a problem for selling a house if you want prospective buyers to be able to see it.

I bring this up because the only way that Google will ever entertain the idea of changing this is if the system is abused en-masse, and even then, they probably won't care, since this has been an issue for years now, so your vandalism will likely persist for years to come.

- stick the barcode on the item, move it to the back so no one gets it, come at later time to snatch it without any suspicion
- keep the weight of the items the same, these scales are very accurate
- works best for higher models/better versions of ""the same"" product
- don't be too greedy, don't do multiple items, spread it, best to combine with other stuff
- buy extra shit that you'll later return
- do it in bigger chain stores, medium size chains have managers who pays closer attention to inventory
- pay cash to leave no trace
- wear fake glasses and dress differently if you're going to do it regularly
- look like a legit customer, you can show the product to a random employee and ask any questions, like, ""it was left in a wrong section, I want to get another one, could you point me where I can find it?"", or ask opinion, like, ""do you think it will look good on me?""
- make sure no one, including other customers see what you're about, they can rat on you
- test the barcode first using the store app or price check point
- if you need to return it, buy the cheaper item with the more expensive item's barcode and return both
- if you can afford things, just pay normal price - this is meant to be for people who are tight on money. Or do whatever TF you want. I'm not your mom",ULPT: Buy a barcode printer and use self checkout to pay less.

I ordered a new $1500 MacBook from Amazon and when it arrived, I noticed that it wobbles when I type, so the frame is damaged/uneven. Now, I know I could have taken it to a Genius Bar and have it fixed, but I wanted a new MacBook, not a defective-then-fixed MacBook. 

So I fought with Amazon for days. They kept telling me to take it to the manufacturer, I kept telling them I wanted an exchange. Finally, after days and maybe 10 representatives, they agreed to send me a new one. But! They said the original MacBook wasn’t returnable because of the lithium batteries. So they let me keep the damaged one, and they’re sending me a brand new one. 

My question is…is there any reason I shouldn’t take the original damaged one to the Genius Bar and have it fixed, then sell it? It’s clearly under warranty, maybe only a week old. 

I don’t know what else I would do with it. It’s not super broken, but it’s broken enough that I wanted a new, perfect one.

We live in a detached house with neighbours either side. We don't get along with the neighbours on one side and haven't for quite some time, one of the ongoing issues is the male neighbour always stares into our property when he's outside. We recently had our garden landscaped and got a privacy fence put up to stop this, unfortunately his garden is higher than ours so when he is in his alleyway he can see over and on multiple occasions my wife or myself have caught him staring in at us. Any time I have seen this he just glares at me then scurries off before I can tell him to stop. 

When he waters his plants or washes his car at the front he stares through our front window.

Just today my wife has come home and he was sitting out the front of his house, he took his sunglasses off and stared at my wife the entire time she was trying to park and until she went into the house. It's getting to the point where she is very distressed and starting to resent living where we are.

The other obstructive thing he is doing is parking his car in a way that makes it very difficult for us to park on our drive. There are 5 houses in our street, they all have a double drive, there is a shared access driveway that allows everyone to get to their property. We live at house 4 and he lives at house 5. He doesn't park his car on his drive he parks on the access  driveway a couple of feet from the property boundary. I've asked him to move further back to allow us to drive up and reverse onto our drive but he refuses saying we should reverse all the way up the drive instead, amongst other things. It is in the deeds as a restrictive covenant that it is a shared access that must be maintained at all times but I've no idea how these things are enforced, if it all.

This is in the UK if that makes a difference.

When I got the money I secretly gave some as a loan so he could go to school for CS, something he’s always been skilled at, and while that’s it’s own issue the main issue is that I need a fake job to explain where my money is going and possibly to escape the house for hours at a time

He does pay attention to my comings and going’s but because as I implied he doesn’t fact check if he doesn’t care, so I just need something that sounds viable but won’t make him feel bad or like depending on me more, we both went through the death but he wasn’t at the Death Bed and he’s a bottomless pit who’s incapable of comforting or helping me.

UnethicalLifeProTips,/r/UnethicalLifeProTips/comments/pq07aa/ulpt_cheap_temporary_car_insurance_uk/,"Disclaimer: I don't know how this applies to countries other than the UK.

Temporary Car insurance tends to be quite expensive. When buying a new car before you've sold the old one, you might have both cars for a few days or weeks and need to either have it Taxed AND Insured, or declare it off the road (SORN); no longer is tax enough, Insurance is mandatory now even if you're not driving it. But you might still need to drive it once or twice. Maybe your prospective buyer wants a test drive. You probably need insurance. A single day policy might be £20, a week might be £50. A whole year might only be £250 so a 1 week temp cover seems dreadfully bad value.


Did you know that when you cancel a 1 year policy you get a pro-rata refund, less an admin fee? 

Did you also know that if you cancel with the 14 day distance selling mandated cooling off period they cannot charge an admin fee?


So, by paying up front for a full year, then cancelling no more than 13 days later, you can get temporary car insurance for less than £1 a day. Thats a significant saving. 

This is only even unethical as it wastes the insurance Companies time a bit. I haven't found any downsides to this.

Now there has been a change in administration and the new dean of the college has levied a fine of ₹ 7750 ( INR ) ( $105.57 ), which is substantial considering I am just a broke med student. ( for reference- an average meal here is ₹ 200- $2.72 )

I *HAVE* to avoid this fine.

I talked to the other students who were also fined, some of them had sent an email to the administration telling them beforehand that they would report late for some reason or the other, and they were not fined. ( the reason had to be genuine though )

Since I didn't anticipate the administration would actually fine us ( as I said before, they have always threatened but never pulled the trigger) I didn't send an email. Is it possible to somehow send a backdated email so I can make up an excuse for reporting late?

Suppose you go to a gym and get a membership. After 8 weeks it ain't working out. Like all gyms they make it a pain to cancel. You have to print out a cancellation form, sign it and mail it to them. You do that.

Next month you're billed. WTF? You send another letter. Month after that? BILLED!

On top of that they snuck an annual fee in there too, so the total might be around $100.

You even FROZE your account after that, which should reduce the fees, but it didn't.

You contacted your bank and filed an automatic dispute, but your band didn't allow you to chirp in during the process. No way to add comments, pics, emails, nothing. Just an automatic dispute and they contact the gym. And they decide the gym is in the right - that I didn't send the letters.

Now you have 3 things left.

1: Burning anger at both the gym and the bank being surprisingly helpful more to the gym

2. You can file a further dispute, whereever that goes.

3. Just let it go.

She started taking up his entire day on Skype and he immediately stopped being useful outside of “dude she’s rich and she believes in us”. She sent him $2500 to get by while we were roughing it in the beginning days. Then that trend continued, until she flew him out to Dubai and realized what a manipulative fuck stick he was.

I went to her before the fuck stick realization happened for a loan on a new product launch that was only about $5k. She agreed but sent a promissory note for $17k which was the $5k plus the money she’d sent him directly that had nothing to do with business. In true moronic fashion I signed it, as she wouldn’t pay it unless it was me who signed it and things in the business were lining up nicely. (Spoiler: They did not line up nicely, instead I deeply penetrated myself while making eye contact missionary style)

All in all we used $5k out of $17k for actual investment or inventory purchase.

Im now paying her $600/mo while he slips further and further into a Xanax fueled Groundhog Day as a 36 year old man in his parents house. He has no job and no money and is heavily addicted to Xanax and apparently started moonlighting as a crackhead which he could spin as a promotion. 

I owe her about $10k now and it’s crippling me since my live in gf lost her job to Covid. 

So, is there a tipping point where it’s no longer worth it for her to sue me from a different country? I don’t feel responsible for this debt, we both were manipulated by the same person and I’ve paid back what she gave me. 

Basically I’m looking for a way around this so that I’m not taking food off my own plate in order to pay my ex business partners ex gf.

UnethicalLifeProTips,/r/UnethicalLifeProTips/comments/po5e8p/ulpt_changing_price_at_checkout_using_chrome/,"About 2 years ago, I went on a website to buy Instagram followers. The website seemed pretty basic and outdated so I snooped around using DevTools and found out I was able to change the price at checkout to whatever I wanted.

I then proceeded to purchase 10,000 fake followers on a test account and changed the price from ""500.00"" to ""0.01"". The purchase button then brought me to PayPal, and the price was legit $0.01. Did that like 4 times then the website was no longer live after a few days.

I've been trying to find this exploit on numerous web pages but had no luck. There are not even tutorials online anymore... there used to be some videos on how to do it.

Is this still possible? Has anybody ever experimented with this? 

\*I do want to add that no one should expect this to work with big web pages such as Amazon. I'm sure they have their security maxed out.",ULPT: Changing price at checkout using Chrome DevTools

How can I get away from it, if you don't do it you'll only get 50% of your grades.

I've considered self harm, like making my voice shit, or forcing myself into a hospital, but I don't want to ruin my voice for something so stupid, nor I like the feeing of pain.

so for now I'm only thinking of some techno shit, problem is, if I disable mic, I can't enter classes, and also, my mom would just pressure me into user other's devices for the microphone.
